Lectures, discussions, and readings are designed to provide a thematically-driven, chronological overview of the period. Yet, the course will not be a traditional \"survey,\" rather, it will focus on some of the key changes in ideas about artistic culture; art practice; and practices of regional, national, and transnational identity formation as expressed in visual art. This course will explore the role of art in social and political revolution, as well as its formative status as an engine of cultural imperialism in the 19th century, and, in addition will explore some of the more traditional approaches to studying the status of art, such as the role of the artist and the transformation of the art \"market\" in the wake of the industrial revolution. Key debates within the field of Art History will be explored, as well. Museum visits required."

What effect does the context in which a photograph is viewed have on its meaning? Designed as a selective history of photography in the 19th and 20th centuries, this course revolves around questions like these about the nature and function of photography in modern culture. Through varied course readings, in-class discussion, thematic lectures, and hands-on research, students will explore the medium of photography from multiple perspectives.\u00a0 In addition to learning about the different photographic genres - exploration and travel photography, studio and portrait work, medical and legal documentation, fine art prints, photojournalism - this class will push students to investigate photography's position within a broader cultural field: the medium's role in advertising and consumer culture; the production and circulation of ideas about race, gender, and national identity; and photography's role in producing history itself. Readings will include primary source materials and theories of photographic meaning; students will be asked to grasp not only the medium's technological and rhetorical functions, but also to develop their own critical perspectives on photography's shifting relations to intellectual, social, and political ideologies. Coursework will include some community-based research, and a museum visit."

    "description": "The cities of Paris and Berlin formed a major axis of cultural production and exchange during the early- to mid-20th century. Both were modern political and industrial capitals, and both cities were vibrant catalysts for the work of cultural producers of all stripes - from artists, writers, filmmakers, musicians, and architects, to social theorists, scientists, psychologists, and political activists. Like magnets, these two cities drew people from across the European and American continents to their streets, offering the promise of cultural ferment and collective interaction, in cities each with their own traditions of avant-garde, modernist practice. But, people also moved between these two cities, creating networks and subcultures, sharing ideas and diverse cultural perspectives, in ways that radically transformed the cultural landscapes of 20th century Europe and America. As capitals, Paris and Berlin also offer views into the major social and political upheavals of the 20th century, culminating in the transformation of a networked, intercultural model of exchange between the two cities, in the 1920's and 1930's, into an actual occupation of Paris by Berlin in 1940. In this course, we will map out these varied structures of exchange by exploring the histories of the two cities through research and analysis of key urban sites, centers, and cultural producers who lived and worked there between 1910 and 1945. Not open to frosh."

Many scholars have rejected the idea that the persistence of a number of racial ills \u2013 like racial inequality, racial discrimination and racial segregation \u2013 in the contemporary moment is evidence that racism also persists as a problem in the twenty-first century. \u201cRacism,\u201d these scholars argue, more accurately describes the Jim Crow South and the people in that era who consciously held explicit beliefs about white superiority over all other races. Though acknowledging changes in racial climate and the terrain of acceptable speech with regards to race, other scholars think that unequal racial outcomes, institutional practices and ideological beliefs connect our contemporary racial problems to racial problems that occurred in the 1960s and earlier. This course is an introduction to the scholarship on racism and has as a central aim to get us to judge together whether \u201cracism\u201d is the appropriate concept to describe and provide a frame through which to understand our contemporary problems concerning race. If it is, which accounts of racism are the most compelling to shed light on our current racial circumstances? What about these accounts are particularly pertinent? What can\u2019t the accounts of racism addressed in class explain? If racism is not the right concept to capture our current struggles with race (or all aspects of it), what concepts if any do a better job and why? To facilitate a critical interrogation of the concept racism, this course will cover sociological, historical, social psychological, philosophical and political accounts of racism and related concepts like racial injustice, racial prejudice, race relations, and racial inequality."

At times, working class women and women of color have also been demonized as carriers of contagion or even romanticized as repositories of traditional wisdom. Furthermore, women\u2019s roles in community health have been heavily shaped by gendered and racial constructions of the body, disease, and wellbeing.\u00a0 Thus, while the focus of the course is on the social history of women\u2019s health and healing, the theoretical framework of the course also aims to explore how ideologies of gender, race, class, and sexuality shape women\u2019s relationship to community health as both caregivers and health-seekers. The course is organized by a set of common themes that cut across time, space, and racial/ethnic boundaries in U.S. History.\u00a0 Themes include: spirituality and healing; work and health; sexuality and reproduction; activism for health justice.\u00a0 An important goal of this course is to make connections between historical studies of women and health and present-day community health activism. Much of the course and especially the community partnership component focuses on the leadership of women of color in shaping agendas for community well-being.\u00a0 In the past, course participants have worked with the organizations Black Women for Wellness, California Latinas for Reproductive Justice, Visi\u00f3n y Compromiso, and Promesa Boyle Heights.

How was the US nation as a whole complicit in the perpetuation of chattel slavery? Finally, how does the US as a nation continue to reckon with the legacies of chattel slavery in contemporary social movements, law, and culture? Course materials include primary documents, first-person narratives, film, music, and groundbreaking historical scholarship."

This course examines the relationship between race rights and revolution during the Atlantic Age of Revolution that stretched from roughly the mid-eighteen to mid-nineteenth centuries. In particular we will explore how Revolutions in British North America France and Haiti influenced the movement to end the slave trade and slavery in the Americas and galvanized slave revolts and other movements for Black liberation and human rights around the Atlantic World. A variety of readings including autobiography social and political history and ethnography will illuminate not only the history of the Atlantic World but new forms of scholarly writing that break the mold of national historical narratives. Themes include: slavery slave revolt the discourse of human rights resistance religion labor and shifting ideologies of difference in particular gender class and race."

    "description": "This course thinks through current debates over the relationship between literary aesthetics and harmony in American democracy. Do aesthetics foster a more harmonious or disharmonious national culture? Is disharmony ever important to progress? How does literature represent protests for social change that are often only possible outside the law, like the many freedmen and freedwomen escaping slavery and demanding the destruction of that system? How does this alter our understandings of what it means to be a fugitive? How can the fugitive fighting for freedom be distinguished from the unprincipled outlaw? From another perspective, we will consider how the complications of American society have altered certain traditional literary forms. While recent scholarship has addressed these questions in regards to early- to mid-20th century literature, this course will look back further, starting from the early 19th century to the very beginning of the 20th. We will complement the literature by reading relevant historical materials from the abolitionist movement, labor movements, government debates over Emancipation and Reconstruction, etc. The course will include literature from Frederick Douglass, Sojourner Truth, Walt Whitman, Ida B Wells, and Charles Chesnutt, amongst others, and will cover several genres, including: oratory, autobiography, political pamphlets, and short fiction."

Students will engage the prison industrial complex, abandonment & deindustrialization, policing, geographic containment, the consumption of blackness as popular culture, formations of neoliberalism, and antiblack state and state-sanctioned terror as contemporary formations of chattel slavery\u2019s afterlives. The course engages the geographic contexts of the US, Jamaica, Haiti, and other parts of the Caribbean."

The first part of the course will examine several industrial processes that have been using enzymes for decades to produce the final commercial product. Emphasis will be placed on the technical challenges required for large-scale production of the compound. Course content will then shift to the academic arena, exploring current processes that the chemical industry wishes to replace with biologically-based systems. The challenges associated with scaling-up these processes will be emphasized, drawing on the foundation laid in the first part of the course. Finally, based on these lectures, students will be asked to take a \"dirty\" chemical process and propose a \"green\" solution, and identify the technical challenges that must be surmounted. An important aspect of the project will be exploring the economic feasibility, as well as potential obstacles related to governmental policies."

In this interdisciplinary studio, students will develop a series of detailed and speculative projects inspired by boundary-pushing artistic and technological practices. The course will examine precedents from contemporary art, media, engineering, performance, design, and technology that offer responses to a wide range of \u201cwhat-if\u201d scenarios. The primary goal of the class will be to guide students as they develop a methodology for making creative and responsive work\u2014one that relies on provocation and imagination as driving forces. Class projects will be designed to develop critical thinking and research skills, art-making and visual communication capabilities, and will call for speculative, even fantastical, responses to complex sites and situations. Technological and data-driven approaches, including data analysis, modeling, and scenario planning, will be integrated into the class assignments, encouraging cross-disciplinary collaborations between computer science and media arts students.\u00a0 Instructional assignments will explore a range of materials, scales, and research methods, and will encourage students to develop their abilities to hone and express innovative responses to complex societal and relational questions. The final series of class projects will address the uncertainty of climate change as a contextual framework, and final proposals may range from site-specific art installations to new applications for robotics; from creating futuristic soundscapes to designing experiences in VR. Site visits and guest lecturers will extend students\u2019 connections with selected Los Angeles sites and their contexts, the understanding of a broad set of perspectives and values, and real-world examples of collaborative, cross-disciplinary projects.\u00a0Not open to First Year Students. Permission of instructor required."

We often think of touch as doing things with our hands, but touch actually affects all parts of the body, and plays a role in smell (particles entering the nose), sound (as vibration or a wave), taste (of the tongue touching), and even vision (through synesthesia or haptic visuality). However, in the current age of social distancing, many of us are feeling \u201ctouch starved,\u201d and looking to digital media as a source of intimacy and community. How can we learn in this moment from haptic technologies, haptic aesthetics, and uses of these in video games, virtual reality, digital-physical art installations, and even early moving pictures? How can we communicate felt experiences as forms of unique knowledge? Drawing from video game studies, humor and gimmicks, feminist film theory, and Black feminist thought, this course takes an interdisciplinary approach to questions of haptic media. Students will complete and give feedback on six short solo haptic pieces and one final collaborative project. The final aim of the course is an exhibition of student work accessible as a web-based virtual exhibition."

Frameworks of history, modernity, and futurity rely on concepts of development and progress that are related to broader ideas of race and sexuality. In what ways do historical representations of time, development, and progress structure how we imagine the future? On whose behalf is progress being imagined? Where is progress located? What are the ideals of the future? Whose pasts are connected to the futures that we privilege? In considering these questions, we will examine a range of novels, films, empirical studies, and cultural theory that provide a complex portrait of how the future is imagined, especially from the perspective of those scripted out of its dominant narrative. We will engage with critical and literary approaches including Afrofuturism, queer futurity, the developmental novel, economic models, and science fiction."

In this course we will read some of the central texts in which these thinkers developed their revolutionary models of analysis: historical materialism, post-metaphysical philosophy, and psychoanalysis. Though very different, what all three of these thinkers had in common was a rejection of the rational subject and with it the notion that commonplace social norms involved in knowledge, morality, and sexuality represented timeless and universal truths determined by a neutral subjectivity. Instead, each sought to explain how these norms were in fact social constructions that are best explained by analyzing the specific historical and sociological conditions in which they arose. For Marx, this project involved an analysis of how power and class relations contribute to the production of \u201cideology\u201d, for Nietzsche an investigation into the history and transformation of morality, and Freud the exploration of the unconscious. The result is a radical transformation of our understanding of subjectivity and a realization of the deeply contingent and malleable nature of human existence. We will investigate these theories by examining works of Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud within their contemporaneous contexts, drawing on the literature, art, and music of the time as well as more recent history and film as points of elucidation and comparison."

Can it be relieved by material wealth, fame, success? For Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard despair was not a passing temporal condition but something that in itself points beyond itself to the possibility of its own overcoming. In doing so, despair, for Kierkegaard, forces open the crucial existential question: What does it mean to be a self? This course will examine this question by exploring changing conceptions of selfhood and despair from antiquity to modernity, moving from Achilleus\u2019 despairing rage in the Iliad to Dostoyevsky\u2019s depiction of the individual revolting against society in the Notes from the Underground and culminating in the seemingly irredeemable despair of Cormack McCarthy.

    "description": "Statesman, scientist, philosopher, poet, and in the words of Friedrich Nietzsche, \u201cthe last German before whom I felt reverence\u201d, this course will examine the life and work of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Widely regarded as the Shakespeare of German literature, Goethe\u2019s status as the major influence on the course of not only 19th century German but European literature was long simply assumed. Yet for a figure of this stature Goethe seems to embody a contradiction. No one quite knows what he stands for. Is Goethe the young Romantic of his youth; the aristocrat and politician of his middle period and founder of the coming of age novel, in which, as Hegel put it, \u201cthe hero loses his horns\u201d; or is he the mad scientist of his later works which he canonically etches into literary history in form of Faust? We will investigate these transformations and contradictions by asking how Goethe\u2019s almost obsessive quest for unity and form can be reconciled with the turmoil, change and disruption so emblematic of his life and work. We will do so by reading the canonical novels and dramas from his early, middle, and late periods, while also spending time with his scientific writings and the most beautiful poetry the German language has to offer. In short, we will examine Goethe not just as an author, but as a practitioner of the art of living. What does It mean to be young, mature, grow old and die? To fashion a self out of the turbulence and change that dominated not only Goethe\u2019s age, but our times as well? We will seek guidance in these questions by examining the interrelationships between Goethe\u2019s life, work and the age that came to be known as the Goethezeit. Reading and discussion will be held in English."

    "name": "Kleist, Kafka, and the Poetics of Madness",
    "description": "This course will investigate the concept of madness as both a social category and\u00a0one of the crucial terms of art and literature.\u00a0 On the one hand, madness often carries with it a negative connotation, as a statement or mental state beyond the realm of sense. Yet on the other, aesthetic theory has long considered madness\u00a0a necessary condition of great art. For the philosopher Immanuel Kant, the art of the genius must break the rules of style and\u00a0explode the bounds of the ordinary sense in order to be exceptional. Art, in this sense must necessarily push the boundaries of the normal, straddle the realms of\u00a0madness and sanity and, in doing so, transform the categories we use to understand the world. Thus, by seeing madness not as some eternal category, but as constructed and deconstructed in concrete contexts,\u00a0the dialectic of madness and genius forces upon us\u00a0the following questions: How does the concept of madness get constructed? Who gets to decide who is and isn't mad and why? Why is the creation of art so tightly bound up with concept of madness? What does this tell us about how we make sense of the world and the possibilities of changing our own forms of understanding? We will investigate these questions by reading works of literature and philosophy that directly and indirectly address issues of madness and its relationship to creativity. \u00a0Readings\u00a0will include works by Michel Foucault, Franz Kafka, Heinrich von Kleist, Honore de Balzac, Virginia Woolf,\u00a0Deleuze & Guattari, Goethe,\u00a0Adalbert Stifter, Immanuel Kant,\u00a0and Ralf Waldo Emerson."

    "name": "Heidegger and the Ecstasy of Being",
    "description": "This course will be centered around an in-depth investigation of one of the most controversial and influential philosophers of the 20th Century, Martin Heidegger. Rejecting what he saw as the tradition of western metaphysics and its quest for absolute knowledge, Heidegger's phenomenological\u00a0approach focused on an analysis of lived experience\u00a0and the structures that make that experience possible. Fundamental to this analysis are the ideas of finitude and fallibility. Human beings, for Heidegger, are never closed and completed, secure in their knowledge and understanding of themselves, but beings who are fundamentally concerned with their own being, who seek to determine themselves from within the complex social, historical, and interpersonal contexts into which they were thrown. As such, philosophy, for Heidegger, becomes interpretation, the attempt to interpret and reinterpret oneself and one's place within a changing and complex world, always with the possibility of failure. The course will investigate this project of \"existential hermeneutics\" through an in-depth investigation of some of Heidegger's major writings. The first half of the course will focus on a close reading of the first half of\u00a0Being and Time\u00a0while in the second half we will look at Heidegger's post war essays, his turn to \"poetic thinking\" and the legacy of Heidegger's thought on 20th century Continental philosophy. We will investigate Heidegger's works from out of their historical context, including Heidegger's relation to National Socialism."

But what was the Enlightenment?\u00a0This course will investigate the Enlightenment in all its complexities and contradictions. As an era defined by radical critique, Enlightenment thinkers rejected the authority of religion, tradition, and aristocracy, and sought to transform our understanding of nature, culture, and history by grounding these fields\u00a0on the transparent rational principles of freedom, progress, and universality. In doing this, the Enlightenment embroiled itself and us in a contradiction. It\u00a0both created the fundamental terms, ideals, and institutions\u00a0that frame our contemporary understanding of the world\u00a0while also establishing a discourse of universality and eurocentrism that serves as the object of our greatest critique. Yet far from being one thing, the Enlightenment also possessed the tools for its own self critique. Or, in the words of Johann Gottfried Herder, \"What is universal reason but a cover for our favorite, whims, idolatry, blindness and laziness?\" Following, Herder, Rousseau, and Goethe, this course will also investigate the alternative conceptions of nature, culture, and history that rejected the universalist and imperialist strand of Enlightenment thinking in favor of a dynamic, process-oriented understanding of history and nature as\u00a0eternally unfolding. With this conception, the Enlightenment perhaps offers\u00a0an alternative to help us in our quest to think beyond it. Readings and persons of engagement may include, Descartes, Locke, Leibniz, Rousseau, Herder, Kant, Goethe,\u00a0Lessing, Defoe, Alexander von Humboldt, Haydn, Mozart, and Schiller.\u00a0\u00a0"

They came into adulthood to realize that their parent\u2019s generation were if not perpetrators then\u00a0at least accomplices to one of the gravest genocides in human history, that they had enthusiastically endorsed a fascistic maniac, that the\u00a0country they inhabited\u00a0stood in ruins, bombed to the ground morally and physically, and that they now stood at the epicenter\u00a0of the cold war, half capitalist, half communist. From the perspective of the 68ers, the worst of all was that there had been no cultural\u00a0reckoning. With the conclusion of the Nuremberg trials and the prosecution of the elite Nazi administration, the majority of the population seemed content to simply to forget. For the 68ers that was not an option. Rather than view the WWII and the Holocaust as an aberration and horrific exception to German culture, the youth of the 68er generation demanded a revolutionary reevaluation of everything German. They asked: What factors, economic, social, cultural, and historical, led to this catastrophe? How can we come to terms with this past? And what vision of a transformed future could replace the old? The answer to these questions involved a three-step approach. A radical critique of the past and the structures of nationalism, patriarchy, heteronormativity, racism, and capitalism, which they believed were the foundational underpinnings of German fascism. Active political dissent that demanded change and culminated in the domestic bombings of the left-wing group the Red Army Faction. And a total re-conception of the norms of society, sexuality, and selfhood perhaps best represented in the Love Parade and the drugs, sex, and radical experimentation that fueled the raves and Berlin techno scene after the fall of the Berlin Wall."

This course examines all aspects of this culture as it developed in the years 800-1600, in order to understand how these people viewed the world, and how this affected their lives and the development of Slavic culture. Communal village life, legends, folk genres and mythology, their sources, and their legacies, are examined. There is a close study of the phenomenon of the vampire, following its evolution from the Iron Age into 18th century Serbia, as a specific case study of how myths are born and persist. The ways in which pagan beliefs were incorporated into Christianity to create the \"dual-faith\" of the Russian peasant are examined, as well. In addition to analytical and historical texts, readings include tales of supernatural beings and phenomena, as well as testimony concerning encounters with the supernatural."

Today, we usually see Roman history and culture from the perspective of Rome\u2019s elites, because the bulk of the surviving texts were written by or for elites. We shall steer a different course, examining texts and material artifacts produced by, for, or about ordinary people. Topics include Roman childhood and the Roman family, kinship relations, mothering and motherhood, child-rearing practices, children\u2019s experience, the death of kin and commemorative practices; the economic circumstances of ordinary Romans, the nature of work, the terms of lending and borrowing, the experiences and cultures of slave-holding and of enslavement; women\u2019s roles as girl (puella), girlfriend (amica), wife (matrona), prostitute (meretrix), and witch (venefica); sex, sexuality, and dirty songs; the people\u2019s entertainments, such as theater, games, gladiator shows, and popular literature; popular politics and the role of the crowd and common person in public life; the culture of soldiering and the experience of peoples at the borders of empire; popular religious phenomena and the appeal of prophets, priests, and holy men in such movements as Isis worship, Mithraism, and Christianity. The goal of the course is for students to emerge with a holistic understanding of the details of and scholarly theories about non-elite culture in the Roman world, and hence with a heightened ability to identify and critically analyze contemporary discourses about \u201clow\u201d versus \u201chigh\u201d culture, which most often remain entirely implicit.\u00a0\u00a0"

Can we have free will and if so, how? Why do we suffer and what can we do to escape suffering? What makes life meaningful if the soul is not immortal?

We will also interrogate the different ways in which writing has been theorized in modernity: as a self-referential symbolic practice; as a form of communication in which memory, experience and knowledge are produced, articulated and organized; and as a procedure of inscription in which language, technology, and bodily gesture are inextricably intertwined. Prominent theorists of writing to be discussed in the course include: Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss, Jacques Derrida, Roland Barthes, Bernhard Siegert, Cornelia Vismann,\u00a0and Friedrich A. Kittler."

We will start with basic questions, such as: whose memories are sought, believed, and commemorated in the public sphere? What problems do traumatic events present for those attempting to represent them? Is trauma a useful cultural concept? What are the differences between individual and collective memory? We will then identify the recent fascination, especially in European and American culture, with the phenomena of trauma, suffering, and victimhood, and focus on the impact on Jewish identity (in various countries), as well as the collective memory of Germans, after 1945."

The impossibility of adequately expressing the atrocities of the Holocaust stands in contrast to the need to transmit knowledge about this event to later generations. Attempts to represent the Holocaust, to describe and understand this event and its implications, are numerous and have occurred across a wide range of media forms (literature, film, photography, art, music, monuments, etc.) and genres (as in documentary, drama, comedy, science fiction). As the Holocaust recedes in time and the numbers of living historical witnesses and survivors decline, these representations increasingly shape our perception and understanding of the event. This course will investigate literary, filmic, and artistic representations of the Holocaust, focusing in particular on questions of ethics, aesthetics, and history."

The group\u2019s assassinations, kidnappings, and bombings of the German establishment left a legacy of terror - a legacy that has been argued over ever since. The literature and films about the Baader-Meinhof Gang, which illustrate the crushing effect of National Socialism on the generation of '68, as well as their rebellion against the excesses of the capitalist consumer paradise, are controversial. Many have condemned the movies for their exciting, Bonnie-and-Clyde depiction of the gang members that gives the group\u2019s leaders their cult status.

Bakhtin's writings are a synthesis of diverse theoretical approaches, including Neo\u00adKantian philosophy, structuralist linguistics, the theory of novelistic discourse as a polyphonic medium, and the notion of carnival as a subversive cultural force. Furthermore, Bakhtin's approach to the text reveals prose fiction, and, to some degree, non\u00adfiction, as a unique medium through which language explores human consciousness in both time and space. In this course, Bakhtin's theories are studied in order to understand more deeply the significance of the novel, and novels are studied in order to better understand Bakhtin's theories. Works as diverse as Fyodor Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment, Venedikt Yerofeev's Moscow to the End of the Line, Umberto Eco's Foucault\u2019s Pendulum, and Manuel Puig's Kiss of the Spider Woman, are examined through the Bakhtinian lens in order to broaden the students' understanding of the text as a polyphonic phenomenon.

Cognitive science offers explanatory paradigms for everything from the appeal of literary characters, dramatic irony, belief in gods, and animal sacrifice. Distributed cognition, that is, the thesis that cognition is embodied, enactive, embedded, and extended is appealed to for new perspectives on ancient theater, public spectacles, religious ceremonies, craft knowledge, and the production, display, and appreciation of architectural forms, sculpture, and paintings. Findings from the science of memory are brought to bear upon Roman strategies for remembering, for commemorating, and for purposely forgetting. Theories of culture drawn from evolutionary anthropology, developmental psychology, and philosophy of biology are adduced to cast new light on our evidence for Roman forms of participatory rather than instructional pedagogy, in-group / out-group formation,\u00a0prosocial and altruistic behavior, and mechanisms of cultural change.

    "description": "After the era of Plato and Aristotle (4th century BCE), Greek and Roman philosophers centered the therapy of psychological suffering in their philosophical programs. Epicurus, for example, wrote, \u201cThere is no use in philosophy, unless it casts out the suffering of the soul.\u201d In this course, we examine the therapeutic programs offered by various ancient philosophical schools: the Peripatetics (followers of Aristotle), Stoics (followers of Zeno of Citium), Epicureans (followers of Epicurus), Skeptics (two schools, one descending from Plato\u2019s Academy and the other from Pyrrho), and finally the Christian philosophy of Augustine of Hippo, which was informed by but also broke decisively with the Greco-Roman philosophical tradition that had preceded it. In order to understand the therapeutic programs of these schools, we shall first have to understand each school\u2019s account of human nature (\u201canthropology,\u201d in its original sense), of the mind or soul (\u201cpsychology,\u201d in its original sense), and of the purpose or \u201cend\u201d of human existence (\u201cethics\u201d). Each school\u2019s answer to the question of why we suffer and how we might find psychological peace\u00a0only makes sense in light of that school\u2019s beliefs about what it is to be human, what is the nature of the mind/soul, and what is the purpose of life. Our source materials in this investigation will include classic texts in ancient ethical thought: Cicero\u2019s Tusculan Disputations, a literary masterpiece cast as a dialogue among prominent Romans who had sought refuge in the countryside as the end of the Roman republic unfolded; Seneca\u2019s On tranquility of mind, which takes the form of a letter to his friend Serenus, who had sought him out to find relief from his distress; and the third book of Augustine\u2019s Confessions, which details the author\u2019s suffering under the afflictions of lust and the apparent paradox of his perverse delight in his own misery."

Zhuangzi, named for its traditional author, \u201cMaster Zhuang\u201d (Zhuangzi), is one of the most important Daoist writings. When the Analects emphasizes that people should reconcile their desires via rituals, and fulfill moral and personal duties in order to ensure the welfare of the society, Zhuangzi promotes carefree wandering and following one\u2019s own nature.

But one form of literature, at least, has always known otherwise. For no matter what philosophy, religion, ethics, or the law try to tell us, comedy will never let us forget that we exist, in this world at least, in and through our bodies. The bodies of comedy, however, unlike the bodies of science, art, or athletics, are neither orderly, nor inspiring, nor ideal. The comedic body is unruly, excessive, needy, offensive\u2014in a word, impolite. What is special about comedy, however, as this class will endeavor to show, is that it encourages us not to despair over our shared condition of gross embodiment, but rather to unite ourselves around it. Comedy creates community from the shared experience of our bodies\u2014 from our corpulent, crapulent, concupiscent corporeality. Having no interest in the maintenance of an ideal \"body politic,\" comedy rejoices in the humble togetherness of a \"body impolitic.\" Though this course will aim to establish a history of comedy from the ancient Greeks and Romans to the Medieval, Renaissance, and Restoration eras (and beyond), it will also make constant reference to modern comedic phenomena; the sit-com, the rom-com, the stand-up, the parody, and the roast\u2014to name but a few.\u00a0"

Traditionally, of course, the myth of Ulysses has been understood as a rather sentimental myth of nostos, or \"homecoming\": the hero, forced by fate into hateful foreign places, finally wins his way back to the security, stability, and contented self-sufficiency of his own native land. Or so the story goes. In this course, however, we will test the thesis that something more like the opposite of this interpretation may hold true. It may be, in other words, that the wanderings of the Ulysses figure (whether through the seas of the Mediterranean, the streets of Dublin, or the isles of the West Indies) work not so much to affirm the self\u00ad-sufficiency and comfort of home, as to trouble and destabilize it. What the heroes of these works might finally come to understand - and may even rejoice in - is not the idea that there is \"no place like home,\" but rather that, in the end, it is only within a certain placelessness that we are ever really \"at home\" at all."

By the 4th century BCE, Plato seems to have concluded that philosophy must eschew any interest in the flesh, inasmuch as flesh (whatever it may be) cannot yield to precise, philosophical investigation. Perhaps even more crucially, Plato stipulated that flesh cannot and should not be the basis of a politics, as it is only philosophical insight, in its disciplined refusal of the lure of the flesh, that could serve as the ground of genuine political communion.

From resistance to the idea of \u201cgay identity\u201d as a colonial-era trap and backlash against emergent gay rights movements, to the strategic complexities of appropriating the state laws supporting gender-reassignment surgery in Iran, the new generation of queer activists and intellectuals are navigating both their own histories and the limits of postcolonial discourse as they seek a liberatory art and politics.

This course will examine various representations of the modern metropolis through film, literature, and cultural theory. The city, as we experience it today, is the product of multiple historical, cultural, and social forces. Over the course of the semester, we will consider how cities have been shaped by these forces, as well as how they, in turn, shape our own experience and understanding of culture, history, and social practices. In an era of increasing globalization and mobility, the role of the metropolis continues to evolve and expand. As we consider representations of the city in a variety of films and novels from around the world, including some from our own city of Los Angeles, we will interrogate the ways in which the city has played a formative role in how we imagine life in the contemporary moment. In what ways has the city become a vehicle for the production of culture? How does life in the city serve to normativize certain notions of what it means to live in the modern world? How does life in rural spaces complicate representations of modernity that take the city as their norm? Does the city promote accessibility, or, alternatively, does it rigidify codes of exclusivity? These are some of the many questions we will address as we consume a spectrum of world cinema and literature. As we work our way through the material, we will strive to develop a complex understanding of how cities shape our cultural imagination."

In particular, in the context of the Middle East, the course will seek to identify and understand both (1) the new forms of popular liberatory action \u2014 revolt, protest, social organizing \u2014 that are made possible or impossible by the widespread adoption of new technological modes of life, and (2) the new forms of state and para-state, surveillance, control, suppression, and disinformation that this technology makes available or encourages by its very structure and embedded premises. \u00a0 Beginning with an analysis of the inner logic and possibilities of modern digital communication technologies as these have been formed in their Western conditions of emergence, the course will then set out to understand how the reception of these new Western technologies in the Middle East (1) give rise to new possibilities for liberatory action via a digital public sphere (for example, the events of the 2009 Iranian uprising and the on-going political movements associated with the 2011 Arab Spring); (2) foster and globally spread new modes of dangerous reactionary politics that include violent, socially destructive forms (for example, ISIS, violent sectarianism and anti-Semitism); and (3) give authoritarian and repressive Middle Eastern regimes new tools and strategies for the surveillance, suppression and social control of their populations (for example, Turkish, Egyptian responses to social movements, and the Iranian governments access to Western mobile phone companies' location information of its citizens to round up protestors, to the use of wide-spread facial recognition technologies and the capacity to quickly spread disinformation or control elections results). \u00a0 The course will bring together a study of critical theoretical work from both Western and Middle Eastern thinkers (for example, of Foucault, Tufekci and Deleuze, Soroush, and Sardar) with the scholarly and vocational writing of technologists in both the West and the Middle East, the accessible operating documents of digital information companies who have played important roles in both making possible and repressing political and social liberation movements in the regions, and the legal and policy documents that both structure and deploy these technologies for and against us."

This course in critical psychology follows the work of Friedrich Nietzsche, Gilles Deleuze, and most recently, Avital Ronell, in a philosophical examination of those operations and technologies that we conduct in order to render ourselves uncomprehending. Stupidity, which has been evicted from the philosophical premises and dumbed down by psychometric psychology, has returned in the postmodern discourse against nation, self, and truth, and makes itself felt in political life, ranging from the presidency to Beavis and Butt-head.

He saw it as the birth of a new spiritual politics. But his naivet\u00e9 regarding the repressive forces at work in the revolution would soon become clear to everyone.\u00a0 Foucault\u2019s misunderstanding of the situation in Iran is emblematic of the complex but foundational relationship between postcolonialism and postmodernism.\u00a0 This course will examine the ways in which the liberatory promise of postmodernism is rethought, rejected or shown to be untenable in the specific contexts of Iran and the broader Middle Eastern and North African postcolonial movements.\u00a0 While acknowledging the liberating power of the postmodern critiques of repressive concepts and structures, we will ask how postmodern thought can be translated into a sustainable and meaningful liberatory politics in places like Iran and the Middle East, and how postcolonial thought and practice are affected by the political and moral possibilities and limits of postmodernism?"

We will begin the semester by exploring theoretical representations of resistance movements within critical legal theory and social movement theory. We will look at different conceptualizations of power and consciousness in our analysis of resistance, and the role of each in instigating resistance movements. We will then turn to an analysis of the law as a tool of collective struggle by studying and comparing the implicated rights and site-specific needs, objectives, strategies, and outcomes of each case study. We will look at the different ways these resistance movements may use the law to mobilize followers, to frame and address collective grievance, to advance and develop legal protections for marginalized groups, and to connect their localized struggles with global ones by redefining and reimagining concepts of dignity and freedom. Each case study will also provide us with an opportunity to explore the relationship between the law, state-sponsored violence, and repression of resistance movements. We will also examine the role and influence of legal advocacy organizations in contemporary resistance movements, and evaluate the current limitations of the law in contributing to social change. How do rights-based claims (e.g. indigenous rights, water rights) obscure the relationship between law and power, injustice, and structures of oppression? Can the law be a useful catalyst for change, and/or is it necessarily a supplement to grassroots organizing and mobilizing efforts? To examine these concepts and tensions, we will look at legislation and legal practices, landmark court cases, and critical scholarship related to our case studies. Among the resistance movements we will likely study are: Brazil's Landless Rural Workers Movement; indigenous resistance movements in North and South America, including resistance to the Dakota Access Pipeline and the Agua Zarca Hydroelectric Dam in Honduras; and different phases in the movement for black civil rights in the United States."

This course will look at the dramatic increase in the number of democracies worldwide over the last thirty years and at case studies that illustrate the political and economic factors behind the increasing number of \"illiberal,\" \"populist,\" and semi-authoritarian democracies; the impact of gridlock and corruption in contemporary democratic systems, including the United States; and the challenges democracies are facing in integrating formerly marginalized populations, including women, poor, and the indigenous. It will examine the United States policy of \"democracy promotion\" and the implications of these trends for the United States in a globalized world."

    "description": "Thirty years after Francis Fukuyama proclaimed the \"End of History,\" political authoritarianism remains viable while democracy is increasingly under threat around the world. Many dictators have embraced hypermobility of capital, free trade, and modern information technology. At the same time, deepening globalization has also challenged long-established democratic systems, producing anti-democratic political movements. We will investigate some of the following questions produced by the clash between global capitalism and local politics: How do authoritarian leaders react to the challenges of globalization in the 21st century? Does globalization undermine or enhance their hold on power? Will authoritarianism or democracy survive a long-term engagement with global markets?"

After considering the concept of democracy, we start by considering some of the classics, published in the second half of the 20th century. These are key works that have shaped the field and have largely set the terms of the debate. Then, we turn to the literature published after 2000 and consider how this literature has revised and built on ideas from the classics. We conclude with an overall assessment of knowledge about democratization and the endurance of democracy. In all, we will discuss explanations that put an emphasis on the economy and culture, as well as on politics itself. Much of what we will read reflects the focus of this literature on Europe, Latin America, and post-Soviet Eurasia. However, some African and Asian cases will be discussed and several global analyses will be considered. Emphasis will be put on the core theoretical and methodological aspects of this literature."

Students will discuss key situations from the last half century involving challenges to human rights, including the phenomenon of disappearances common in Argentina and Chile in the 1970's, violations of human rights during leading up to and during civil conflicts in Central America, and the impact of neoliberal economic reforms on human rights in the region. Students will explore the application of the death penalty in the United States, United States foreign policy on human rights in the Americas during the Cold War, and the claims of human rights abuse by the United States during the War on Terror. They will also have a chance to examine the United States from a double perspective: on the one hand as a key country with a major interest and impact on human rights conditions in Latin America, and, on the other, as a country with its own policy areas of struggle and progress."

Currently, direct foreign political interventions have been scaled back, but economic interventions by international organizations and foreign states have increased. Even though liberal democracy is winning favor the structural basis of inequality remains with increasing unemployment, poor education, weak health services, inadequate housing, soaring food and utility prices, and increasing levels of poverty. Opposition movements demand changes ranging from subsidized basic foodstuff to free education. This has contributed to political tensions as states scramble to suppress resistance while still trying to maintain the conditions required by global economic institutions.

You will be introduced to the continent through the perspectives of four critical African literary and political thinkers, each bringing a novel perspective to African political identity. These texts illustrate the nuances of a contested identity that is ascriptive and that derives meaning from local and indigenous roots.\u00a0 While each author writes about specific countries in Africa, they highlight themes of significance to the broader experiences of colonialism, revolution, and post-colonial systems. They also engage with the racism intrinsic to Whiteness/Eurocentrism that frames the parameters of this field."

Our goal is to gain understanding of why European states have taken different political paths (including countries in Eastern Europe, the Nordic\u00a0states, and Turkey), while also exploring the context of regional integration in which European states are embedded. The European Union (formerly the European Community) and its 28-member states are thus also central to this subject, as it encapsulates the development of key political institutions, civil society, representation, and economics on the continent. We will thus explore what has been accomplished by European integration (e.g., maintaining peace, increasing mobility, granting human rights, enhancing multilateralism, and strengthening democracy), as well as the considerable challenges that lie ahead (e.g., \"Brexit\", eastern enlargement, the stability of the Euro, the integration of refugees, and the rise of populist parties). In sum, the course is designed to introduce students to central topics in both past and contemporary Europe politics through the lens of political science and theories of regional integration. Situated at the intersection of comparative and international politics, these theories will help us to understand the complex interactions between national governments,\u00a0supranational institutions,\u00a0and the everyday lives of European citizens that define Europe today."

The level of revolutionary zeal, ideological debates, and mass participation has elicited unprecedented attention by media experts and academics endeavoring to resolve what is termed as the \"Persian Puzzle\" or \"Iranian Paradox\". In view of the remarkable infrequency of revolutions, Nikki Keddie - the eminent scholar of modern Iran - has devoted years of research in striving to answer the question: \"why has Iran been revolutionary?\" She reiterates that Iran has seen more modern revolutions than any country in the Muslim world and more than most countries anywhere. Consequently, the course on \"Revolutionary Iran\" addresses the following question: is there anything peculiar or particular about Iran that could explain the rise of modern revolutionary movement? The course critically examines the theoretical and historical perspectives that have been proposed to answer this question."

What are the sorts of strategies these actors have used in addressing such health issues as: HIV/AIDS, malaria, unsafe food and water, tobacco use, and others? What is the role of human rights in addressing the underlying determinants of ill-health? The course will present basic concepts for understanding global public health, including morbidity; mortality; demography; epidemiology; and the political, social, and economic determinants of health. We will utilize a case study method to examine successful and less successful efforts to improve global health and to debate enduring political, economic, social, and cultural controversies in the arenas of global health.

How has the role of violent conflict in international politics changed since the end of World War II? What is the nature of security today? These general questions will frame explorations of more specific strategic questions. Such questions will include: how do states and non-state actors use force to persuade their enemies to take (coercion), or refrain from taking (deterrence), a particular action? How can nations best prepare to prevent violent conflicts or to win them if they occur? What has determined success and failure and the intensity, duration, and consequences of military action? We will have a particular focus on emerging transnational security issues, intra-state security, and the relationship between security development and state failure. Pursuing answers to these questions will require an approach that integrates theory, history, and current events.\u00a0"

This course is a seminar on Asian security, covering military security, non-traditional security, and economic and political security, among other dimensions. The course surveys the Asian region, with particular emphasis on Southeast Asia (the ASEAN countries, particularly Cambodia Burma/Myanmar, Thailand, and Singapore) and Northeast Asia (China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan). The material is divided into three parts. The first provides an overall introduction and overview of Asian security and focuses on the foundations of what was thought to be the Asian Miracle (created in part from a U.S. security umbrella), just as the Washington Consensus rose to prominence. It takes students through the Asian Financial Crisis and its aftermath. Part two of the class focuses on Japan, South Korea, China, and Taiwan. It describes their development trajectories and security arrangements. Part three uses China as a platform to examine other parts of Asia not already covered, such as: China's relationship with Southeast Asia, and the political economy of non-traditional security, in particular the region's experience with Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza."

In doing so, we will take an in-depth empirical look at movements for civil rights, women\u2019s rights, LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) rights, and immigrant rights. An analysis of these movements across multiple domestic and transnational contexts should give us an angle with which to critically assess the theoretical concepts we will engage.

This course is designed to gain leverage on the processes that explain such changes by surveying an eclectic literature on comparative and transnational LGBT politics: from social movements to normative change in international relations. For these fields of study, the changes addressed above pose several important questions. It is no coincidence, for example, that dozens of countries now grant some form of same-sex unions, and understanding transnational politics helps us understand why. Specially, we will ask: What factors have facilitated the mobilization of LGBT people? Why and how have public opinion and state laws towards LGBT people changed differently across various countries?"

Students will analyze how trade, culture (music, food, sports, language, education), environment, and political institutions (democracy, corruption, human rights, etc.) contribute to a country's soft power and make up its global brand. Students will analyze the current state of soft power in key nations and consider how countries and their citizens can affect the attractiveness of a country's culture, ideas, and institutions in order to raise its soft power.

More specifically, the course will deal with: (1) the evolving meaning of prevention as it was understood in the Charter of the United Nations and subsequently shaped by the changing causes and nature of conflicts; (2) the main actors in conflict prevention against the backdrop of UN institutions; (3) the tools and practice of \"operational\" prevention (i.e. early warning, mediation, sanctions, peace operations, peace enforcement, and the role of regional organizations); (4) the tools and practice of \"structural\" prevention (good governance and democracy, mainstreaming human rights and gender, meeting post conflict reconstruction, and addressing the root causes of conflict); and (5) the significance of the emerging norm of the \"responsibility to protect\"."

In this course, students will explore the social, historical and political-economic factors that have contributed to the development, growth and sustenance of the \"school-to-prison\u00a0pipeline.\" Through an examination of a wide range of texts and sources that sit at the intersection of K-12 schooling, criminal justice, social welfare, and community-based organizing\u00a0and activism, students will be prepared to critically interrogate educational policies,\u00a0practices and other structures of schooling that buttress and deconstruct\u00a0this phenomenon.\u00a0Sophomore standing required."

Given this view, schooling functions as a terrain of ongoing struggle over what will be accepted as legitimate knowledge and culture. In accordance with this notion, critical pedagogy must seriously address the concept of cultural politics, both legitimizing and challenging cultural experiences that comprise the histories and social realities that, in turn, comprise the forms and boundaries that give meaning to student lives.

We will study the films of Ernst Lubitsch, Billy Wilder, Fritz Lang, Robert Siodmak, Michael Curtiz, and Otto Preminger, paying particular attention to how they formulated key aspects of film noir and romantic comedy. While film noir paints a bleak picture of passion, violence, and desperation in American culture, the rom com structure promises pleasure and reconciliation, transgressive zaniness wedded to social order. But films in these two contrasting genres often tell different versions of the same story, or provide entangled perspectives on related American possibilities, and we will continually compare them in order to consider issues of cinematographic technique and style, plot and tone, agency and structure, capitalism and class, gender and sexuality, as well as race and power. Throughout the course, we\u2019ll learn to think about how these filmmakers experienced exile, and how that experience made its way into their films. In addition to coming away with a basic grasp of film history and analysis, as well as the importance of genre in the evolution of American cinema, students will also learn about the early history of Hollywood and the complex relationship between Jewishness, antifascism, and whiteness in the first half of\u00a0the 20th century."

We will also read Renaissance romances about the challenges of tempering the desire for revenge (Cervantes, Spenser). Our study of these literary works will enable us to understand key developments in the legal and religious thinking of Renaissance Europe (especially England), and the relevance of these innovations to the complex role revenge plays in our current moment. We will likewise survey some influential philosophers of revenge from antiquity to the present, and if time allows, we\u2019ll examine the importance of revenge to contemporary fiction and film. Some questions we\u2019ll ask include: How have artists imagined the desire for and consequences of revenge? What cultural and legal structures have been constructed to produce, mediate, temper, or sublimate vengefulness? How have modern conceptions of justice relied on, or occluded, revenge? When does revenge uphold structures of oppression and when can it aid in resisting or abolishing them? This class will give you tools to analyze the long history of revenge and its ramifications for literature and law in Renaissance England, and enable you to think more critically about the role of revenge in our own legal, political, and cultural worlds today."

At the same time, we will explore what is productively strange, challenging, and even alienating about these texts from the past, measuring how their distance from us provides unique opportunities for thinking. We will also examine how authors such as Chaucer, Shakespeare, Spenser, and Milton came to constitute the foundation of the English literary canon, and how this canon has been used to advance (or to critique) English national and colonial ideologies.

From Homer's The Odyssey and Grimm's fairytales, to Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and Salman Rushdie's Shame,\u00a0monsters challenge our everyday ideas about normality. Situated between the animal and the human, monstrous creatures are ciphers for difference that force us to consider what we regard as culturally abject or grotesque, as well as alluring. That these mythical figures continue to fascinate even as they frighten, is suggestive of their symbolic power in embodying both our latent desires and prohibitions. This course will explore the emergence of the monstrous aesthetic across several genres (epic, drama, novel, poetry, film) and periods (Renaissance to contemporary) to probe the shifting terrains of sexual, racial, and cultural otherness that monsters represent. Along the way, we will ask critical questions that arise from the study of monstrosity. What, for instance, separates monsters from humans? How does monstrosity define our notions about beauty and ugliness, desire and disgust? Does the monster appear each time under a different guise? If so, to what extent does it reshape our sensibility about what is socially abnormal? What can monsters teach us about the hopes and apprehensions of the cultures and times to which they belong? Ultimately, we will seek to understand how and why these ferocious figures also elicit sympathy in us toward those markedly unlike ourselves.

    "description": "Before the modern novel, we had romance: the literature of error and erring, stories of characters who set out on a quest and lose their way due to madness, obsession, lack of faith, or the difficulty of knowing the truth about themselves or their quests. Romance was one of the most important genres of imaginative literature in medieval and Renaissance Europe, and yet it was also the one that provoked the most profound moral and aesthetic concern. Hugely popular, romance was often condemned for its endless attention to pleasure, pain, error, and forgetting, for its perverse magical stories of exploration and complicity, for its unseemly analysis of chivalric duty and obsession--and even for its capacity to corrupt its readers beyond repair. (Famously, Don Quixote was driven mad by reading romances!) Whether viewed as a genre of utopian dreaming or of lurid and dangerous narrative failure, romance is a vexed concept. By examining pre-modern and modern genre theory, this class will explore the formation of the category of romance across medieval and Renaissance England (with some attention paid to France, Italy, and Spain), thus giving students an opportunity to consider how genre can enable and constrain understanding of particular works of literature. Texts may include Virgil's Aeneid, Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes Arthurian tales, Geoffrey Chaucer's Troilus and Crisyede, the anonymous Pearl-Poet\u2019s Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Miguel de Cervantes's Don Quixote, Philip Sidney\u2019s Arcadia, Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queene, William Shakespeare\u2019s Cymbeline, and Mary Wroth\u2019s Urania. At the end of the semester, we may turn to more recent works (such as Samuel R. Delany's speculative fictions or Caroline Bergvall's poetics of error) to get a sense of how pre-modern romance remains an archive for some of the most exciting literary production today."

Readings include classical and humanist poetic and rhetorical theory (from Plato to Puttenham) and a wide range of poets, including Thomas Wyatt, Anne Locke, Philip Sidney, Edmund Spenser, William Shakespeare, John Donne, John Milton, Andrew Marvell, Mary Wroth, and Katherine Philips, as well as some consideration of the influence Renaissance verse has had on modern poets (such as T.S. Eliot, Frank O'Hara, and Marilyn Nelson)."

    "description": "This seminar will explore the development of lyric poetry and of theoretical reflections on lyric in Anglophone modernity, with a focus on the historical evolution of three poetic kinds since the Renaissance: the sonnet, the elegy, and environmental poetry (especially pastoral and georgic). Canvassing the ways \u201clyric\u201d has functioned as a term for particular kinds of expression, thought, and classification, this class will provide students with a set of tools to read and write about an archive of short poetry from the sixteenth century to the contemporary moment. Even though it is ostensibly the most personal and hermetic of literary genres, lyric poetry is often produced by what the philosopher Theodor Adorno calls a \u201ccollective undercurrent\u201d--a complex shuttling between individual voice and the social structures that shape the forms and possibilities of expression. We will attend to how lyric has crystalized different historically situated understandings of self and society, with an eye towards how the form of a short poem exposes aesthetic, philosophical, and political questions of great urgency.\u00a0"

From land enclosure and privatization to colonialism and slavery, primitive accumulation made--and continues to make--the world we live in. We will read key works in Marxist theory, along with literary and historical texts by authors such as Christopher Columbus, Thomas More, Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas, Edmund Spenser, and William Shakespeare, in order to study representations of race, economy, and environmental extraction in the fictions that some early modern Europeans told about their role in a new global society."

This class explores the literary responses to such shifts in the culture of punishment and the project of state-building, asking why some of the most innovative works of drama, poetry, and prose in this period struggle with the purpose and effects of imprisonment, trial, penance, and slavery. Four main topics will organize the course: punishment and colonialism; the economic, theological, rhetorical, and theatrical underpinnings of legal trial; martyrdom; and the rise of the transatlantic slave trade. Each section of the course is divided into a series of sub-topics (ranging from questions of genre and psychology, to the humanist culture of teaching) to be explored through examination of a literary text and related historical and theoretical materials. Authors will include: John Foxe, Elizabeth I, Edmund Spenser, Michel de Montaigne, William Shakespeare, John Milton, Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and Aphra Behn, among others."

    "description": "This course examines the increasing centrality of the theme of \"tyranny\" to American literature before 1900. Most people know the founders justified the American Revolution\u00a0 as a response to Britain's tyranny during the colonial period. Fewer know that \"tyranny\" became a watchword for national debates over race, gender, and class conflicts. What happens to the idea of \"tyranny\" when it refers to threats within a nation rather than outside forces? What happens when the calls for revolution that founded the nation are asserted once again, to save the nation from its worst self? The political and ethical political implications of this 18th and 19th century conflict reverberate today. Only a multi-genre approach, incorporating a wide range of authors, could do justice to these questions. For these reasons, we will examine revolutionary pamphlets, speeches, essays, freed-persons narratives, and poetry from authors as diverse as Joseph Warren, Phillis Wheatley, Phillip Freneau, Harriet Jacobs, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Walt Whitman, and Emily Dickinson. Finally, this course listens to voices too often obscured by our focus on well-known characters in American history: the unofficial soldiers of the American Revolution, the freed-persons who emancipated themselves from slavery, the conflicted Civil War Veterans, and the working-class Americans trying to find their place in Reconstruction-era America.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Major Requirement Met: Group II"

Along the way, students will address several questions: How does literature represent demands for social change that transgress the law, like the freed persons escaping slavery? How to distinguish fugitives fighting for freedom from unprincipled outlaws? Is emancipation a single act, legal declaration or a more complicated process? And for whom? Finally, how do we grapple with the backlash to political change? By focusing on the 19th century, we can rethink how African Americans found political agency generations before the most familiar events from the Civil Rights era. Most of all, this course allows students to read literature alongside historical documents, so they can see firsthand how debates over freedom evolved in the 19th\u00a0century.\u00a0"

    "description": "Since the 2008 Crash, politicians, scholars, and journalists have compared America's current economic challenges to the Great Depression.\u00a0This frequent comparison does not exhaust the significance of the Great Depression for the U.S. or the rest of the world. The 1930s is such an intriguing decade because the global economic collapse spawned new, or renewed older, political and artistic movements. In the global 1930's, people considered art central to rethinking political allegiances and the overarching meaning of politics itself. The 1930s helps to clarify the following question in our present-day: what cultural rebuilding remains to be done and how does art contribute to such processes? Writers of the 1930's took up this question in several different forms: through the trope of the document and its archival drive, the unconscious and the search for the Marvelous, the raised fist of labor movements or anti\u00adracist activism. This course will look at several literary (and related art) movements in, and cutting across, America, the Caribbean, and Europe. Texts will include (but are not limited to) documentary writing from Muriel Rukeyser, Richard Wright, and Langston Hughes; Surrealist writing from Europe and the Caribbean, including Aime Cesaire and Georges Bataille; and other forms of art like the photography of Cathy Cahun."

We will analyze the impact of unification on the growth of right-wing militancy throughout Germany, and examine examples of Neo-Nazi and skinhead activities, as well as the efforts of various governments to control this movement. A key question will be why exactly young people between the ages of 15 and 30 are drawn to these groups that often use and develop sophisticated networks. Finally, the question will be asked as to what the most effective means of combating these movements would, or should, be. Not open to first year students."

    "description": "A basic understanding of Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud is a prerequisite for participating in critical debates in the humanities and social sciences. In this course we will read some of the central texts in which these thinkers developed their revolutionary models of analysis: historical materialism, post-metaphysical philosophy, and psychoanalysis. Though different, what all three of these thinkers had in common was a rejection of the rational subject and with it the notion that commonplace social norms involved in knowledge, morality, and sexuality represented timeless and universal truths determined by a neutral subjectivity. Instead, each sought to explain how these norms were in fact social constructions that are best explained by analyzing the specific historical and sociological conditions in which they arose. For Marx, this project involved an analysis of how power and class relations contribute to the production of \u201cideology\u201d, for Nietzsche an investigation into the history and transformation of morality, and Freud the exploration of the unconscious. The result is a radical transformation of our understanding of subjectivity and a realization of the deeply contingent and malleable nature of human existence. We will investigate these theories by examining works of Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud within their contemporaneous contexts, drawing on the literature, art, and music of the time as well as more recent history and film as points of elucidation and comparison.

Starting with the writings of Johann Caspar Lavater, whose monumental \"Physiognomic Fragments\" (1775-1778) advocated physiognomy as a means of \"promoting human understanding and human love,\" this course will explore the widespread influence that the art of interpreting physical features had in the intellectual and artistic milieu of the 18th century, and, arguably, continues to exert in the modern day. We will examine physiognomy in the aesthetic, cultural, literary, and scientific contexts of the German Enlightenment, dealing with such major figures as Goethe, Lessing, Lichtenberg, Schiller, and Hegel, as well as its unprecedented boom in popularity around 1900, when it was embraced by many prominent strands of German thought, from the \"philosophy of life\" (Nietzsche, Spengler, Kassner) and literary modernism (Rilke, Benn, Musil), to eugenics, criminology, and racial biology. In concluding with the rise of Nazism and their attacks on modern art as \"degenerate,\" the course will assess to what extent Walter Benjamin's thesis that \"[t]here is no document of civilization which is not at the same time a document of barbarism\" holds true for the historical trajectory of German thought. Topics include: the relationship between texts and images, theories and practices of interpretation, as well as the complicity of the arts and sciences in constructing theories of racial difference.

We will also interrogate the different ways in which writing has been theorized in modernity: as a self-referential symbolic practice; as a form of communication in which memory, experience, and knowledge are produced, articulated, and organized; and as a procedure of inscription in which language, technology, and bodily gesture are inextricably intertwined.

Art, in this sense must necessarily push the boundaries of the normal, straddle the realms of\u00a0madness and sanity and, in doing so, transform the categories we use to understand the world. Thus by seeing madness not as some eternal category, but as constructed and deconstructed in concrete contexts,\u00a0the dialectic of madness and genius forces upon us\u00a0the following questions: How does the concept of madness get constructed? Who gets to decide who is and isn't mad and why? Why is the creation of art so tightly bound up with concept of madness? What does this tell us about how we make sense of the world and the possibilities of changing our own forms of understanding? We will investigate these questions by reading works of literature and philosophy that directly and indirectly address issues of madness and its relationship to creativity. \u00a0Readings\u00a0will include works by Michel Foucault, Franz Kafka, Heinrich von Kleist, Honore de Balzac, Virginia Woolf,\u00a0Deleuze & Guattari, Goethe,\u00a0Adalbert Stifter, Immanuel Kant,\u00a0and Ralf Waldo Emerson."

    "description": "What is despair and what does it tell us about being human that we alone can seemingly experience it? Is it equivalent to sadness or depression? Can it be relieved by material wealth, fame, success? For Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard despair was not a passing temporal condition but something that in itself points beyond itself to the possibility of its own overcoming. In doing so, despair, for Kierkegaard, forces open the crucial existential question: What does it mean to be a self? This course will examine this question by exploring changing conceptions of selfhood and despair from antiquity to modernity, moving from Achilleus\u2019 despairing rage in the Iliad to Dostoyevsky\u2019s depiction of the individual revolting against society in the Notes From the Underground and culminating in the seemingly irredeemable despair of Cormack McCarthy. Readings will include works by Homer, Plato, Thucydides, the Stoics, Marguerite of Porete, Meister Eckhart, Martin Luther, Soren Kierkegaard, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Leo Tolstoy, Franz Kafka, Cormack McCarthy, and Flannery O\u2019Connor. In addition to the English section, this course will meet for an additional session per week to read the and discuss the German language and other supplementary texts in their original. Readings will occur in German and will serve as an introduction to the major\u00a0developments of the German language from Middle High German to the advent of High German in the writings of Martin Luther\u00a0to its modern iterations in Hermann Hesse. Authors\u00a0will include among others, Meister Eckhart, Martin Luther, Franz Kafka, and Hermann Hesse\u00a0while discussion\u00a0will occur in English and German and focus on the intricacies\u00a0\u00a0of the original language text and developing arguments out of it.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

    "name": "Heidegger and the Ecstasy of Being",
    "description": "This course will be centered around an in-depth investigation of one of the most controversial and influential philosophers of the 20th Century, Martin Heidegger. Rejecting what he saw as the tradition of western metaphysics and its quest for absolute knowledge, Heidegger's phenomenological\u00a0approach focused on an analysis of lived experience\u00a0and the structures that make that experience possible. Fundamental to this analysis are the ideas of finitude and fallibility. Human beings, for Heidegger, are never closed and completed, secure in their knowledge and understanding of themselves, but beings who are fundamentally concerned with their own being, who seek to determine themselves from within the complex social, historical, and interpersonal contexts into which they were thrown. As such, philosophy, for Heidegger, becomes interpretation, the attempt to interpret and reinterpret oneself and one's place within a changing and complex world, always with the possibility of failure. The course will investigate this project of \"existential hermeneutics\" through an in-depth investigation of some of Heidegger's major writings. The first half of the course will focus on a close reading of the first half of\u00a0Being and Time\u00a0while in the second half we will look at Heidegger's post war essays, his turn to \"poetic thinking\" and the legacy of Heidegger's thought on 20th century Continental philosophy. We will investigate Heidegger's works from out of their historical context, including Heidegger's relation to National Socialism."

    "description": "Derided or revered, there is no question that the Enlightenment is important. But what was the Enlightenment?\u00a0This course will investigate the Enlightenment in all its complexities and contradictions. As an era defined by radical critique, Enlightenment thinkers rejected the authority of religion, tradition, and aristocracy, and sought to transform our understanding of nature, culture, and history by grounding these fields\u00a0on the transparent rational principles of freedom, progress, and universality. In doing this, the Enlightenment embroiled itself and us in a contradiction. It\u00a0both created the fundamental terms, ideals, and institutions\u00a0that frame our contemporary understanding of the world\u00a0while also establishing a discourse of universality and eurocentrism that serves as the object of our greatest critique. Yet far from being one thing, the Enlightenment also possessed the tools for its own self critique. Or, in the words of Johann Gottfried Herder, \"What is universal reason but a cover for our favorite, whims, idolatry, blindness and laziness.?\" Following, Herder, Rousseau, and Goethe, this course will also investigate the alternative conceptions of nature, culture, and history that rejected the universalist and imperialist strand of Enlightenment thinking in favor of a dynamic, process-oriented understanding of history and nature as\u00a0eternally unfolding. With this conception, the Enlightenment perhaps offers\u00a0an alternative to help us in our quest to think beyond it. Readings and persons of engagement may include, Descartes, Locke, Leibniz, Rousseau, Herder, Kant, Goethe,\u00a0Lessing, Defoe, Alexander von Humboldt, Haydn, Mozart, and Schiller.\u00a0\u00a0"

They came into adulthood to realize that their parent\u2019s generation were if not perpetrators then\u00a0at least accomplices to one of the gravest genocides in human history, that they had enthusiastically endorsed a fascistic manic, that the\u00a0country they inhabited\u00a0stood in ruins, bombed to the ground morally and physically, and that they now stood at the epicenter\u00a0of the cold war, half capitalist, half communist. From the perspective of the 68ers, the worst of all was that there had been no cultural\u00a0reckoning. With the conclusion of the Nuremberg trials and the prosecution of the elite Nazi administration, the majority of the population seemed content to simply to forget. For the 68ers that was not an option. Rather than view the WWII and the Holocaust as an aberration and horrific exception to German culture, the youth of the 68er generation demanded a revolutionary reevaluation of everything German. They asked: What factors, economic, social, cultural, and historical, led to this catastrophe? How can we come to terms with this past? And what vision of a transformed future could replace the old? The answer to these questions involved a three-step approach. A radical critique of the past and the structures of nationalism, patriarchy, heteronormativity, racism, and capitalism, which they believed were the foundational underpinnings of German fascism. Active political dissent that demanded change and culminated in the domestic bombings of the left-wing group the Red Army Faction. And a total re-conception of the norms of society, sexuality, and selfhood perhaps best represented in the Love Parade and the drugs, sex, and radical experimentation that fueled the raves and Berlin techno scene after the fall of the Berlin Wall."

In its wake, the \"weaker\" economies, mostly at the periphery, were more affected than the stronger ones. But, there are also other problems, such as the lack of democratic structures, as well as strong leadership, the weight of a centralized bureaucracy, and the lack of a European public sphere.

In this course, we shall therefore attempt to use the experience of Greek tragedy, in all its ecstatic strangeness, as a powerful point of entry into the difficult, yet crucial, works these philosophers have bequeathed to us.

We will read Aeschylus' Oresteia trilogy, Euripides' Medea, Aristophanes' Thesmophoriazusae, and selections from contemporary scholars.

In this class, we shall attempt to answer the question of why style matters so deeply to us by relating the history of stylistic preferences (from ancient to modern times) to the history of metaphysics, to the question of Being itself. In other words, this course will test the thesis that our preferences for electric guitar over acoustic, for oil paint over water color, for free verse over iambic pentameter, have less to do with this or that particular thing within the world than they do with the way we answer the question of how or why there is a world for us, at all. The Greek section of this course will be devoted to translation of\u00a0The Iliad from the original, paying particular attention to the ways in which the Homeric epic has been received in the almost three millennia since its original appearance\u037e this will give our investigation into the history of style in the West (and its possible metaphysical grounds) a carefully delimited focal point."

But one form of literature, at least, has always known otherwise. For no matter what philosophy, religion, ethics, or the law try to tell us, comedy will never let us forget that we exist, in this world at least, in and through our bodies. The bodies of comedy, however, unlike the bodies of science, art, or athletics, are neither orderly, nor inspiring, nor ideal. The comedic body is unruly, excessive, needy, offensive\u2014in a word, impolite. What is special about comedy, however, as this class will endeavor to show, is that it encourages us not to despair over our shared condition of gross embodiment, but rather to unite ourselves around it. Comedy creates community from the shared experience of our bodies\u2014 from our corpulent, crapulent, concupiscent corporeality. Having no interest in the maintenance of an ideal \"body politic,\" comedy rejoices in the humble togetherness of a \"body impolitic.\" Though this course will aim to establish a history of comedy from the ancient Greeks and Romans to the Medieval, Renaissance, and Restoration eras (and beyond), it will also make constant reference to modern comedic phenomena; the sit-com, the rom-com, the stand-up, the parody, and the roast\u2014to name but a few. In addition to attending the 3 hours of lecture required of students in CSLC 285, students in Greek 385 are required to attend an additional 90 minutes of class per week to read and discuss texts in the original language.\u00a0Students in this course are required to complete a 10-12-page interpretive paper, one that incorporates the students' own translations of original texts.

Traditionally, of course, the myth of Ulysses has been understood as a rather sentimental myth of nostos, or \"homecoming\": the hero, forced by fate into hateful foreign places, finally wins his way back to the security, stability, and contented self-\u00adsufficiency of his own native land. Or so the story goes. In this course, however, we will test the thesis that something more like the opposite of this interpretation may hold true. It may be, in other words, that the wanderings of the Ulysses figure (whether through the seas of the Mediterranean, the streets of Dublin, or the isles of the West Indies) work not so much to affirm the self\u00ad-sufficiency and comfort of home, as to trouble and destabilize it. What the heroes of these works might finally come to understand - and may even rejoice in - is not the idea that there is \"no place like home,\" but rather that, in the end, it is only within a certain placelessness that we are ever really \"at home,\" at all.

And yet, as this course shall argue, the work itself\u2014and in some ways, the entirety of Plato\u2019s literary and philosophic oeuvre\u2014might be understood as structured around a single question: namely, how are we to connect the experience of human desire with the necessity of human community?

By the 4th century BCE, Plato seems to have concluded that philosophy must eschew any interest in the flesh, inasmuch as flesh (whatever it may be) cannot yield to precise, philosophical investigation. Perhaps even more crucially, Plato stipulated that flesh cannot and should not be the basis of a politics, as it is only philosophical insight, in its disciplined refusal of the lure of the flesh, that could serve as the ground of genuine political communion. From here it was but a short step to conclude that poetry (and of course, \"art in general\"), entangled as it was with the body, could have little meaning or import for the practice of either politics or philosophy."

Each case study offers a unique perspective on the question of how broad economic structures of colonization, slavery, and the market revolution shaped human encounters between natives and newcomers, captives and captors, slaves and slaveholders, Northerners and Southerners. Ultimately, these case studies encourage a critical rethinking of concepts of liberty, equality, and democracy, which have formed the bedrock of master narratives in United States history.

    "description": "This course offers a survey of postcolonial Latin America as a process of cultural transformation, political struggle, and economic change. We will explore the complex challenges of colonial legacies posed to emerging nation-states in the 19th and 20th centuries, and seek a balance between engaging particular histories and larger processes common to the region. The first section of the course introduces themes of the 19th century: colonial heritage and the different routes taken to political independence; the political, economic, and social challenges of independence in a multi-cultural context; citizenship and race; and the development of export agriculture. The second section introduces themes of the 20th century: industrialization, revolution, U.S.-Latin American relations, and select intellectual trends. Students will use a variety of sources, including scholarly works, films, and primary sources to engage these topics and issues."

From there we focus on the French Revolution, following its legacy and impact through the revolutions of the 19th century, the rise of Socialism and Communism, the Russian Revolution, the\u00a0Chinese Revolution,\u00a0decolonization and revolutions in Africa, and the Cuban Revolution. The course looks closely at how these revolutions in thought and politics changed the way people understood their relationship to state and society. In the search for global connectivity, we review revolutionary movements beyond the western European and United States \u00a0to include cultures and civilizations of \u00a0Asia, the Middle East, Africa and the Americas.

We will examine this topic through study of the social, economic, and cultural history of the region while remaining cognizant of how global forces from the mid-19th century affected, what was historically, the southern part of Ottoman Syria. The aim of the course is to provide a historical overview of the struggle in the eastern Mediterranean, which has become known as the proper noun, the \"Arab-Israeli Conflict.\" Rather than treating this struggle as the latest, inevitable iteration of a millennia-old, Middle Eastern conflict, this class examines its specific modern historical contexts. Our approach is chronological and we will cover a variety of topics and questions. A sampling of our topics: 19th-century Palestine, the emergence of nationalism as a historical phenomenon, early Zionist settlement in Palestine and Palestinian society at the beginning of the twentieth Century, Zionist women activists and Palestinian women, World War I and British rule, the 1936-39 Palestinian Revolt, the 1948 War for Palestine and its aftermath, Israeli-Arab relations in the 1950s, the Suez War, the implications of gendering the nation, the 1967 War and the subsequent occupation of the West Bank, Gaza and the Golan Heights, the demographic \"race,\" Israel in Lebanon, the Intifadas, and the peace processes."

    "description": "According to Thomas Jefferson, America was to be an \"agrarian Republic\" - a pastoral farmland, a different world from the dirty and decaying cities of monarchical Europe. Yet, by Jefferson's day, it was already too late. North America had been dotted with great metropolises and minor towns for thousands of years, and new waves of European and African settlers founded hundreds of new ones, as well. Indeed, for many early migrants, America was itself a \"city on the hill\" - an urban image for a new society. In this course, we will survey American urban history from those early days to the present, focusing, in the second half, specifically on Los Angeles, where new forms of decentralized urbanism took form in the 20th century. We will not only explore suburbia and freeways, Disneyland, and other quasi\u00adurban outposts, but also the changing character of the inner city in the mid-20th century, as well as radical efforts to reform existing American cities. In the process, we encounter the American city of today - multicentered, privately planned, decentralized, and multiethnic. We will conclude by asking whether contemporary developments in urbanism - the changing character of public space, the turn to privatism, the neglect of public transport infrastructures, and challenges to democracy and equality - are ultimately compatible with the American dream of the \"city on the hill\" for the 21st century."

Our investigation of U.S. engagement with the wider world rests on the understanding that as America's influence on the world grew, so did the world's influence on America. Lectures and readings will cover America's political and military dealings with other powers - that is, U.S. diplomatic history as traditionally understood - but will also address Americans' cultural, social, economic, and intellectual interactions with foreign peoples, both at home and abroad. Specific topics include: U.S. overseas imperialism, the U.S. role in both World Wars and the Cold War, the heightened significance of Asia and the Pacific World after 1940, internationalism and the creation of the United Nations, the emergence of the Third World and Washington's ambivalent relationship to global decolonization, Americans' involvement in the global revolutions of the 1960's, the economic upheavals of the 1970's, the end of the Cold War, and the politics of a post-Cold War and post-9/11 world."

And yes, there will indeed be oranges, palm trees, and earthquakes playing their roles in this complex and varied story, as well.

    "description": "With its capital in Europe since 1363 and spanning Europe, Asia and Africa for nearly five centuries the Ottoman Empire was perhaps the most successful and longest enduring experiment in multiculturalism the world has ever known. Multi-lingual, multi-ethnic and multi-religious Ottoman society and culture were comprised of Muslim, Byzantine Christian, Turkish, Greek, Persian, Mongol, Slavic, Armenian, Arab, African and Jewish cultural elements. Edicts from the Ottoman state were regularly issued in nine languages. One reason for its longevity was its willingness to draw on the diversity of this rich historical and cultural tableau. In this course, we will examine the complex social, cultural and political transformations occurring in the Ottoman Empire from its inception as a small principality in western Anatolia until it reached its zenith when it stretched into modern-day Austria."

At the heart of the course is a digital humanities component that will involve students in researching the lives and ideas of individual Black activists. At the end of the course, we will contribute our collective research to the national website, Colored Conventions. While engaged in original historical research, students will also be reading exciting scholarship on the rise of free Black communities in the U.S. and the emergence of African American institutions (churches, schools, press, political organizations). We will delve into questions such as: how did free African Americans, from leadership to grassroots levels, organize for racial equality, abolition, and community empowerment? How did class structures and gender ideology shape the dynamics of Black organizing? What transnational relationships and diasporic identities did Black activists build in the protracted struggles for abolition and citizenship?"

In the period between World War I and World War II, new and alternative models for the relationship between state and society challenged the existing political and social order, as many Europeans abandoned democracy as the ideal political system. Many turned to nationalist authoritarianism as the answer to the political, economic, and social crises shaking Europe. Italy, under the National Fascist Party, and Germany, ruled by the National Socialists, were the nations in which this flight from democracy became a full-fledged descent into dictatorship and one-\u00adparty rule.

We will study indigenous strategies of both resistance and accommodation to the imposition of Catholicism, the origins of the devotion to the Virgin of Guadalupe, the Mexican Inquisition, millenarian movements, missions, and women in the church in the colonial period. Our study concludes with the anti-clerical reforms of the late nineteenth- and early twentieth-centuries, the Cristero Rebellion, increasing influence of Protestantism, and the persistence of local religions in modern Mexico. Students will analyze historical documents, religious dramas, confessional manuals, Inquisition records, paintings, sculptures, and films in their examination of the history of religion and spirituality in Mexico."

    "description": "Since the fall of the Mexica (Aztecs) to the Spaniards in August of 1521, writers and artists have represented the dramatic events leading to the conquest of Mexico. Major figures of the conquest, such as Hernando Cort\u00e9s, Malinche, Moteuczoma, and Cuahtemoc, have been memorialized, mythologized, and in some cases villainized. This course examines representations of the conquest and the leading figures of the period from a variety of perspectives. We will consider how changing political and cultural contexts have shaped remembrances of the war and the consequences of colonial rule. In this course, students will analyze a variety of sources, including Spanish and indigenous accounts, pictorial writings, paintings and artworks, operas and films. In addition, we will examine contemporary artistic projects, museum exhibitions, and archival programs that have been organized to commemorate the 500-year anniversary since the fall of the Aztec Empire."

The central theme will be how the state and grassroots society negotiated the course of the nation and its political culture since 1875. We will critically examine the production of the dominant historical narrative and develop alternative ones that can help us understand the differences in the historical experiences of subaltern groups, including women, indigenous people, and campesinos within the Porfirian, revolutionary, and post-revolutionary periods. We will examine what is cultural about politics and what is political about culture through an interdisciplinary format, perspective and organization drawing upon the fields of history, anthropology, literature, and visual studies."

At times, working class women and women of color have also been demonized as carriers of contagion or even romanticized as repositories of traditional wisdom. Furthermore, women\u2019s roles in community health have been heavily shaped by gendered and racial constructions of the body, disease, and wellbeing.\u00a0 Thus, while the focus of the course is on the social history of women\u2019s health and healing, the theoretical framework of the course also aims to explore how ideologies of gender, race, class, and sexuality shape women\u2019s relationship to community health as both caregivers and health-seekers. The course is organized by a set of common themes that cut across time, space, and racial/ethnic boundaries in U.S. History.\u00a0 Themes include: spirituality and healing; work and health; sexuality and reproduction; activism for health justice.\u00a0 An important goal of this course is to make connections between historical studies of women and health and present-day community health activism. Much of the course and especially the community partnership component focuses on the leadership of women of color in shaping agendas for community well-being.\u00a0 In the past, course participants have worked with the organizations Black Women for Wellness, California Latinas for Reproductive Justice, Visi\u00f3n y Compromiso, and Promesa Boyle Heights. We will continue to work this year with women\u2019s health organizations and the Southern California Library on a Reproductive Justice community partnership. In addition, we will welcome several community health activists & scholars to the class as guest speakers."

The timings and patterns of decolonization are extremely varied so we will narrow our focus to the core periods of decolonization in Asia and Africa from the 1920s to 1960s and nationalism and revolution in Latin America from the 1920s to 1980s. We will also consider the Third World Movement in the United States in the 1960s and 1970s. We will define decolonization as the political struggle for legal sovereignty, as well as social movement for moral justice and political solidarity against imperialism both formal and informal, and external and internal. Topics will include: the role of metropolitan and international politics; economy and labor; nationalism and anticolonialism; race and ethnicity; and gender and sexuality in the Pan-African movement; decolonization in India and the Middle East; the nationalist movements of China, Vietnam, and Indonesia; and the revolutions of Mexico Cuba and Central America.

Nevertheless, Muslims often describe themselves as constituting a single community with shared sets of concerns. This class engages these differing views through an examination of the lives of Muslims over the past two centuries of globalization, colonialism, post-colonialism, nationalism, and ever-changing technologies of transportation and communication. Our inquiry will concentrate on how Muslims were caught up in, and reacted to, and, in turn, influenced the Great Transformation that reshaped the entire world over the past two centuries. Dealing with issues from state building to women's rights to radical militancy, this class considers the various features of what we might call Muslim Modernity."

We will investigate the ways that rural populations were incorporated into, or excluded from, the processes of state-formation. Finally, we will look at how representations of peasant/tribe, in ideologies of state-building and nationalism, shaped social and political relations within some of the region's nation-states. While we will discuss the region as a whole, we will focus most of our attention on two empirical cases: Iraq and Egypt."

In this course, we will draw on colonial and postcolonial theory to reinterpret these stories in the historical context of a set of encounters involving the Americas and the Americans - native and immigrant, from Europe, Asia, and Africa - with the rest of the world, contacts that began in 1492 and are still going on today. In the process, we will explore a diverse array of borderlands between people, environments, mythologies, and histories - spaces of interaction and reinvention. But these borderland spaces are fragile; contact zones devolve, again and again, into conquest, domination, genocide, and empire. Although this is a transnational phenomenon, this course is primarily concerned with the frontier in North America and particularly in the American West and in California. Along the way, we will also be doing our own original archival research, so students will have a chance to make their own mark upon the long history of the American frontier experience.\u2028"

Yet beneath both sets of images lie a set of crucial social, demographic, and political changes that marked Los Angeles's emergence as an industrial, as well as cultural, center - changes that put the city on the front lines of many struggles revolving around Civil Rights, housing, and the future of American urbanism itself. In this class, we will explore the sunshine and the noir of mid-twentieth century LA, focusing on the ways cultural forms (such as the Central Avenue Jazz Renaissance, film noir, and modern architecture) crystallize crucial postwar\u00a0social and political battles within this complex modern metropolis."

Just thirty years ago, about 80% of the Chinese population lived in the countryside, mostly working in agriculture. Today, China's population is over half urban, and the CCP has announced a new plan to speed up the urbanization process so that by 2020, 60% will be urban. Furthermore, well over 100 million migrants travel back and forth between the countryside and the city each year. While these numbers are impressive in and of themselves, it can be hard to understand what they mean for individuals, for particular social groups, and for the changing rural and urban landscapes. Nonetheless, this shift from a predominantly rural population to an urban focused society is both ambitious and fraught with problems. This class aims to give an in-depth and up\u00ad-close look at this amazing social transformation through readings, class lectures, film, research projects, and, most importantly, in-country experience.

The variety of natural and built environments in Mesoamerica has produced a diversity of social, cultural, and political landscapes. This seminar explores the ways in which different cultural groups have perceived, used, managed, and conserved the Mesoamerican environment from colonial times to the present. We will address a number of interrelated questions about the relationship between Mesoamerican societies and the environment. How have natural environments established parameters for human economic and social activity? How have Mesoamericans interpreted and then reshaped their environmental surroundings to satisfy their supposed needs? What impact have race and gender had on perceptions of the environment? What have been the environmental consequences of the colonial, subsistence, and agro-export economies the 19th century infatuation with progress and the 20th century creation of industrial and urban conglomerations under the aegis of developmentalist ideologies? What is the historical geography of five centuries of sustained degradation and sporadic conservation of Mesoamerica's bio-physical environments? How have different groups of Latin Americans interacted in their quest to manage, control, and distribute natural resources?

The idea, actuality, and experience of genocide in the twentieth century have raised questions about the very nature of society and humanity. By studying the genocidal crises of the modern age, from the Armenian Genocide of 1915 to the Holocaust to the contemporary genocide in Darfur in the Sudan, we are forced to consider the darkest chapters of modern history and the ethical trauma that follows in their wake. While most students have heard of the Nazi-perpetrated Holocaust, which murdered the Jews of Europe, the other genocides of the last hundred years are less well known. This course, by comparing the societies which experienced genocide and the conditions which produced it, will examine the psychological, cultural, and societal roots of human cruelty, mass violence, and genocide.

For some, the Lebanese Civil War of 1975-1990 seemed to confirm the \u201csectarian thesis\u201d about the Middle East. \u00a0Indeed, the war-torn Lebanese capital, Beirut (divided as it was between an eastern \u201cChristian\u201d enclave and a western \u201cMuslim\u201d enclave), became a metonym for sectarian conflict.

Today, we usually see Roman history and culture from the perspective of Rome\u2019s elites, because the bulk of the surviving texts were written by or for elites. We shall steer a different course, examining texts and material artifacts produced by, for, or about ordinary people. Topics include Roman childhood and the Roman family, kinship relations, mothering and motherhood, child-rearing practices, children\u2019s experience, the death of kin and commemorative practices; the economic circumstances of ordinary Romans, the nature of work, the terms of lending and borrowing, the experiences and cultures of slave-holding and of enslavement; women\u2019s roles as girl (puella), girlfriend (amica), wife (matrona), prostitute (meretrix), and witch (venefica); sex, sexuality, and dirty songs; the people\u2019s entertainments, such as theater, games, gladiator shows, and popular literature; popular politics and the role of the crowd and common person in public life; the culture of soldiering and the experience of peoples at the borders of empire; popular religious phenomena and the appeal of prophets, priests, and holy men in such movements as Isis worship, Mithraism, and Christianity. The goal of the course is for students to emerge with a holistic understanding of the details of and scholarly theories about non-elite culture in the Roman world, and hence with a heightened ability to identify and critically analyze contemporary discourses about \u201clow\u201d versus \u201chigh\u201d culture, which most often remain entirely implicit.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

    "description": "Lucretius' poem\u00a0On the Nature of Things\u00a0is not only a watershed moment\u00a0in\u00a0Roman philosophy and Latin\u00a0poetry,\u00a0but also a touchstone in\u00a0world thought and\u00a0literature from the Renaissance to\u00a0Postmodernism.\u00a0Lucretius (c.99-c.55 BCE)\u00a0was a materialist. For him, reality consisted of atoms and compounds of atoms situated in empty space. We will try to come to grips with Lucretius'\u00a0answers to questions such as the following: Where, in a purely physical world, is there a place for conscious beings like ourselves? Can we have free will and if so, how? Why do we suffer and what can we do to escape suffering? What makes life meaningful if the soul is not immortal? What does it mean to be a moral person if the gods take no interest in us or our actions? What do we owe each other, as creatures living\u00a0together in community? As we examine these questions we will also attend carefully to Lucretius'\u00a0poetic artistry, to the\u00a0rhetorical strategies by which he attempts to convert his audience, to his atomic physics, and to his place as a political thinker writing during the fall of the Roman republic. In this 5-unit course we will be reading Lucretius\u00a0in the original Latin, and will address the ways in which his poem's semantic content, syntax, and literary form work with (or against) one another to produce that texture of Roman cultural significance that is the\u00a0de Rerum."

    "description": "This interdisciplinary course, featuring ancient Roman texts in the original Latin, introduces students to the ways in which theories and findings\u00a0from cognitive science\u00a0can cast new light on Roman literature, theater, philosophy, law, science, religious practice, and graphic arts. Cognitive science offers explanatory paradigms for everything from the appeal of literary characters, dramatic irony, belief in gods, and animal sacrifice. Distributed cognition, that is, the thesis that cognition is embodied, enactive, embedded, and extended is appealed to for new perspectives on ancient theater, public spectacles, religious ceremonies, craft knowledge, and the production, display, and appreciation of architectural forms, sculpture, and paintings. Findings from the science of memory are brought to bear upon Roman strategies for remembering, for commemorating, and for purposely forgetting. Theories of culture drawn from evolutionary anthropology, developmental psychology, and philosophy of biology are adduced to cast new light on our evidence for Roman forms of participatory rather than instructional pedagogy, in-group / out-group formation,\u00a0prosocial and altruistic behavior, and mechanisms of cultural change. These topics will be examined through close readings in the original Latin drawn from\u00a0Cato the Elder, Cicero, Livy, Vitruvius, and others."

    "name": "Why Do We Suffer? Ancient Therapies of the Soul",
    "description": "After the era of Plato and Aristotle (4th century BCE), Greek and Roman philosophers centered the therapy of psychological suffering in their philosophical programs. Epicurus, for example, wrote, \u201cThere is no use in philosophy, unless it casts out the suffering of the soul.\u201d In this course, we examine the therapeutic programs offered by various ancient philosophical schools: the Peripatetics (followers of Aristotle), Stoics (followers of Zeno of Citium), Epicureans (followers of Epicurus), Skeptics (two schools, one descending from Plato\u2019s Academy and the other from Pyrrho), and finally the Christian philosophy of Augustine of Hippo, which was informed by but also broke decisively with the Greco-Roman philosophical tradition that had preceded it. In order to understand the therapeutic programs of these schools, we shall first have to understand each school\u2019s account of human nature (\u201canthropology,\u201d in its original sense), of the mind or soul (\u201cpsychology,\u201d in its original sense), and of the purpose or \u201cend\u201d of human existence (\u201cethics\u201d). Each school\u2019s answer to the question of why we suffer and how we might find psychological peace\u00a0only makes sense in light of that school\u2019s beliefs about what it is to be human, what is the nature of the mind/soul, and what is the purpose of life. Our source materials in this investigation will include classic texts in ancient ethical thought: Cicero\u2019s Tusculan Disputations, a literary masterpiece cast as a dialogue among prominent Romans who had sought refuge in the countryside as the end of the Roman republic unfolded; Seneca\u2019s On tranquility of mind, which takes the form of a letter to his friend Serenus, who had sought him out to find relief from his distress; and the third book of Augustine\u2019s Confessions, which details the author\u2019s suffering under the afflictions of lust and the apparent paradox of his perverse delight in his own misery."

    "description": "The assassination of Pompey the Great in September of 48 B.C.E sealed the fate of the Roman republic. Pompey\u2019s military leadership had been the republicans\u2019 last hope of preserving Rome\u2019s constitutional order in the face of the dictatorial ambitions of Julius Caesar, who had in effect declared war on his own country in 49 B.C.E when he brought his army across the Rubicon river into Italy from Gaul. With Pompey gone, the republic was lost.\n\nSome Romans\u2014including the statesman, orator, and philosopher Marcus Tullius Cicero\u2014resisted Caesar with the pen, not the sword. In works such as On the Republic and On the Laws, Cicero articulated and urged upon his fellow citizens the merits of republican government, its basis in popular sovereignty, and the moral and political virtues of the rule of laws not men. A group of republican conspirators who sought to restore the old order assassinated Caesar in 44 B.C.E. They were, in turn, destroyed by Caesar\u2019s would-be heirs. In the tumult, Cicero was assassinated by the Caesarian faction for his political speech and activism.\n\nCicero\u2019s writings and their influence survived his assassination and have inspired opponents of tyranny and proponents of self-government for over 2000 years. In this course, we engage with the legacy of Roman republicanism, and its historically unprecedented regime of rights, laws, and constitutional norms. We read foundational texts by Cicero and the Roman historian Livy as well as by later political theorists who drew inspiration from them, such as Machiavelli, who re-introduced the theory of republican government into a Renaissance Europe ruled by princes in his 1517 treatise Discourses on Livy, and John Adams (the \u201cAmerican Cicero\u201d), whose 1787 work Defence of the Constitutions of the United States of America owed much to Ciceronian thought and made the Constitution that we have today\u2014the oldest constitution in the world, and one that many perceive as now under threat\u2014the world-changing document that it has proved to be."

Significant attention will be paid to the way each of these works continues to contribute to our own modern expressions and notions of love, in all their ecstatic, heartbreaking, inspiring and frustrating complexity."

We will consider common themes and forms shared by these works, as well as the ways in which they stand apart creating a diversity of voices. Secondary readings will provide context for our investigation into the socio-political contexts of these works, while play attendance will keep our focus on these plays as performance. There is a ticket fee of $50 for the course."

This seminar engages the fields of Native American Studies, Chicanx Studies, Mexican history, and U.S. Western history to trace the historiography of a region that has undergone a series of extensive transformations in the last three hundred years. In the modern era, it changed from a periphery of the Spanish empire, to provinces of northern Mexico, and finally, to the southwestern region of the United States. The area is a site of complicated and overlapping histories marked by processes of colonialism, diaspora, nationalism, and deterritorialization. With particular attention to issues of race, gender, place and power, prominent historiographical themes for the course include: the frontier thesis; war and displacement; transborder and transcultural communities; labor and transnational capitalism; extractivism and environmental justice; and migration and militarization.\u00a0"

The variety of natural and built environments in Mesoamerica has produced a diversity of social, cultural, and political landscapes. This seminar explores the ways in which different cultural groups have perceived, used, managed, and conserved the Mesoamerican environment from colonial times to the present. We will address a number of interrelated questions about the relationship between Mesoamerican societies and the environment. How have natural environments established parameters for human economic and social activity? How have Mesoamericans interpreted and then reshaped their environmental surroundings to satisfy their supposed needs? What impact have race and gender had on perceptions of the environment? What have been the environmental consequences of the colonial, subsistence, and agro-export economies the 19th century infatuation with progress and the 20th century creation of industrial and urban conglomerations under the aegis of developmentalist ideologies? What is the historical geography of five centuries of sustained degradation and sporadic conservation of Mesoamerica's bio-physical environments? How have different groups of Latin Americans interacted in their quest to manage, control, and distribute natural resources? We will pay particular attention to how the relationship between humans and their natural and built environments shaped Mesoamerica's social and political development."

We often think of touch as doing things with our hands, but touch actually affects all parts of the body, and plays a role in smell (particles entering the nose), sound (as vibration or a wave), taste (of the tongue touching), and even vision (through synesthesia or haptic visuality). However, in the current age of social distancing, many of us are feeling \u201ctouch starved,\u201d and looking to digital media as a source of intimacy and community. How can we learn in this moment from haptic technologies, haptic aesthetics, and uses of these in video games, virtual reality, digital-physical art installations, and even early moving pictures? How can we communicate felt experiences as forms of unique knowledge? Drawing from video game studies, humor and gimmicks, feminist film theory, and Black feminist thought, this course takes an interdisciplinary approach to questions of haptic media.

The emergence of this tonal system enables instrumental music to sustain a listener's attention through dramatic forms and without the aid of words; comprehending how these forms behave is one of the central tasks of this course. In turn, the cultivation of instrumental genres will fuel the operatic accomplishments of Classical composers, notably Mozart. Our study of vocal and instrumental music proceeds chronologically and focuses on individual cities, starting with Florence at the end of the Renaissance and ending with Vienna, the music of Beethoven and Schubert, and the emergence of musical Romanticism. This course may be used by Music majors to fulfill the Second-Stage Writing Requirement. Not open to first-year students."

After surveying the music of the first generation of Romantic composers (with special attention to the music of Fryderyk Chopin), we turn to Richard Wagner\u2019s music and writings and how they shaped the rise of modernism in music, with its new forms, genres, styles, and pitch systems. We then take up jazz, the radical experimentation of the 1920s ultra-modernists, and music under fascism. Thereafter, we study all subsequent major musical developments, through to post-minimalism and hip hop. Throughout, we will be alert to the political, philosophical, and cultural forces shaping the music at issue.

This course examines the evolution of this concept within and beyond the Wagnerian context, from its prehistory in eighteenth-century theories of beauty and taste, to sound film and music videos, to contemporary Los Angeles dining experiences (such as at Craig Thornton\u2019s Wolvesmouth and Jordan Kahn\u2019s Vespertine) that pick up where Wagner\u2019s theories left off. To chart this history will require us to consider theater, music, dance, painting, architecture, philosophy, film, and gastronomy. Throughout we will investigate\u00a0the roles\u00a0that attentiveness and perception play in these multi-sensory events, and consider how European thought and practices migrate and get translated to a contemporary, North American context. Guest lectures by artists and restaurateurs will be supplemented by field trips to Los Angeles arts and dining venues. No previous musical experience required.\u00a0"

The last three weeks on campus will be devoted to German language instruction and individual research projects. The on-campus component of the course will culminate in transforming Bird Studio into a Viennese coffee house which will welcome the campus community and during which students must impersonate through knowledgeable conversation a contemporaneous Viennese figure central to their field of research. This immersive on-campus study will crescendo to the downbeat of the course: the week after Commencement you will board a flight for Vienna for three weeks of intensive study there convening as a class each day attending lectures classes (including a cooking class!) and concerts and visiting the historical cultural and musical sites we studied on campus. We will take three three-hour guided walking tours of architectural monuments of historical (including music-historical) monuments and of Viennese coffee houses.

For Kierkegaard, the fundamental problem of philosophy was to describe what it means and what it takes to become human\u2014suggesting, ironically, that it is possible for a human being not to be human. The primary purpose of this\u00a0course\u00a0is to read Kierkegaard\u2019s most influential texts closely, situate them in their historical and philosophical context (namely, early 19th Century Western Europe), and draw out their contemporary relevance, paying particular attention to the concepts of irony, anxiety, despair, love, and faith. \u00a0"

Topics for discussion will include: to what extent am I free and to what extent am I the product of circumstances beyond my control? What is the nature of moral agency and moral responsibility? How can I live authentically and establish my own identity? How ought I to relate to the majority and minority cultures that surround me and of which I may be a part?"

    "description": "The course will cover such topics as whether space and time exist, how we know what the geometry of space and time is, whether any sense can be made of the claim that time has a direction, and the \"paradoxes\" of time travel. We will examine these questions in the context of both pre-relativistic and relativistic theories. The readings will range from historical figures such as Newton, Leibniz and Mach to contemporary work by both philosophers and physicists including Hawking, Feynman, Thorne and Sklar. This course does not require previous exposure to Special or General Relativity and will not require as a prerequisite technical skills that go beyond high school mathematics and physics, but students are expected to be comfortable with algebraic and geometric reasoning."

Occidental students will develop and teach their own lesson plans. \u00a0In order to do so, students will select a children\u2019s picture book, identify a philosophical question raised by the book, review and selectively incorporate academic philosophical texts. In addition, the class will discuss philosophical views on young children, the nature of philosophical wonder/inquiry, and the value of a (philosophical) education, e.g. Rousseau's Emile, excerpts from Plato, Marx, and contemporary philosophers."

Many scholars have rejected the idea that the persistence of a number of racial ills \u2013 like racial inequality, racial discrimination and racial segregation \u2013 in the contemporary moment is evidence that racism also persists as a problem in the twenty-first century. \u201cRacism,\u201d these scholars argue, more accurately describes the Jim Crow South and the people in that era who consciously held explicit beliefs about white superiority over all other races.

This course is an introduction to the scholarship on racism and has as a central aim to get us to judge together whether \u201cracism\u201d is the appropriate concept to describe and provide a frame through which to understand our contemporary problems concerning race. If it is, which accounts of racism are the most compelling to shed light on our current racial circumstances? What about these accounts are particularly pertinent?

Students will participate in the daily activities of a campaign for United States President or United States Senate in a key \"battleground\" state. Students will gain experience in the highest level of politics and gain an understanding of how a national presidential campaign or a statewide United States Senate campaign is operated. Students will learn about political strategy voter contact and turnout messaging and polling communications volunteer recruitment and team-building fundraising and other key aspects of campaigns. The internship will involve working full-time (a minimum of 40 hours a week) from the first day of class until Election Day. Following that ten-week campaign fieldwork internship students will return to campus and participate in two seminars as part of Campaign Semester. Campaigns involve long hard days. The staff that students will work with will typically be working at least 14-16 hour days. Although students are required to work at least 8 hours a day they are likely to work more. As part of the Campaign Fieldwork Internship students will be required to read three books-biographies of each major party candidate and a book describing previous presidential campaigns. Students will be required to maintain an internship journal that will be handed in at the end of the 10-week internship. The journal will describe their activities (including the projects they work on campaign meetings and events relationship of the campaign to the media and to constituency groups) the internal dynamics and work of the campaign the different roles and tasks of staff and volunteers in the campaigns the way the media reports on the campaign the students' reflections on these matters and at the end a summary of the campaign outcome. Students will be required to email the supervising Occidental faculty member at least once a week about their activities and reflections. The students will be supervised in the field by a campaign staff member. Students will participate through teleconferencing in a two-hour course meeting with other students and faculty three times during the semester. Students who will be working in different parts of the country will stay in touch with each other as well as with the faculty through Moodle a web-based course management system.

The first two are friendly critics who seek to fortify liberalism against what they see as its latent pathologies, while Nietzsche is a not-so-friendly critic who wants to overturn it entirely. Given that liberalism is under attack today from both the right and the left, there is much to gain from serious study of their reflections. In this course, we will compare the strengths and weaknesses of their diagnoses of the present and visions for the future. Guiding questions for the course will include the following: Does liberal democracy uplift human beings, or degrade them? How should the competing demands of individual independence and community solidarity be balanced? How can we best counter modern society\u2019s tendency to engender stifling conformity? What is the significance of Christianity for the cultural heritage of Western society? What role, if any, should religion play in societies of the future? Finally, what does human flourishing consist of, and what kind of sociopolitical conditions best facilitate it? The culminating assignment of for the course will be a substantial research paper on one or more of these thinkers."

At the crossroads of linguistics, psychology, and neuroscience, psycholinguistics is concerned with providing an explanation of how the human language processing system works. This course introduces students to the main goals, theories, and experimental methods of psycholinguistic research. We discuss the current state of our understanding of language learning and processing, as well as the experimental and analytical techniques that have been used to examine these issues."

We will also consider the ways in which Chican@s have looked to their spirituality and religious practices in order to construct narratives of identity belonging community and resistance."

In 1907, a wealthy Mexican landowner named Francisco Madero regularly channeled the spirits of the dead. They instructed him to write a book advocating for democratic reform, which helped ignite the Mexican Revolution of 1910 that led to Madero's being elected president. In\u00a01930s Jamaica, the Rastafari\u00a0 movement emerged as a potent political force that raised black consciousness and challenged colonial British rule. And in the mid-century United States, a spiritually awake counterculture challenged the status quo and redefined the cultural trajectory of postwar America. Using these case studies, we will ask how religions - through prophesy, apocalypticism, and messianism - can unsettle even seemingly secure polities, as well as how religion can function to maintain the status quo."

How should the community structure rituals of death and what should be done with corpses? And how -- if at all -- will individuals live on in an afterlife? The central goal of this course is to familiarize students with the diversity of notions about death dying and afterlife in ancient cultures by analyzing literature (philosophical medical and poetic), rituals, and monuments of the ancient Mediterranean world. We will then contextualize these ideas noting how and why they developed from driving concerns and circumstances of particular communities, cultures, and historical moments."

This course describes the changes Stalin brought to Soviet society the terrible consequences of his dictatorship and the reaction of cultural figures criticized as they rebelled against the system. This course examines those movements through popular culture film literature and first-hand testimony. The everyday life of Soviet citizens will be studied by looking at both permitted and forbidden forms of entertainment. The dissident movement that erupted in the 1960s and 1970s will be examined through the Sotsart artistic movement as well as short stories that circulated underground throughout the late Soviet period. Finally the course will look at Stalin's legacy in Putin's authoritarian Russia of the twenty-first century."

Through this exploration, we begin to understand how architecture, interior design, fashion history and the act of dressing evolved throughout the centuries and across cultures because of technological advancements, changes in economic and social class structures, in political climates and through appropriation of cultural aesthetics. Why was there a kimono specialist in the costume department of Westworld? How did Ruth E. Carter develop her Afrofuturist vision for Black Panther? Where would you find visual and dramaturgical resources for Vietgone, or Hair, or Cambodian Rock Band, the action of each set in a similar historical period but whose stories are told from very different cultural perspectives?

Throughout the course, students develop techniques for gathering and analyzing multimodal transcripts of naturally occurring conversations, interviews, discourses in institutional settings, media discourses, and texts of historical materials. The course draws from systemic functional linguistics, genre/text studies, multi-modal semiotics, interactional sociolinguistics, and critical social theory to understand how linguistic features of texts constitute, and are constituted by, the social, cultural, and local relations, processes, and contexts in which they are embedded. Using a seminar format, students will engage the readings and apply discourse analysis strategies in order to develop their own independent qualitative research projects."

This class positions the study of feminist rhetorics within the larger study of language and discourse theories as we examine how social relations power knowledge and identities are constituted through private and public rhetorical acts. Through our readings we will engage a wide range of contributions to a rhetorical critical history by women who either as practitioners or theorists advanced their visions of social change and acted to implement them. Course readings will begin in antiquity to provide a foundation for our study though much of our material will focus on texts from the nineteenth-century to the present to examine the intersections of gender and rhetoric. Through this work we will challenge the seeming erasure of women from this critical history and interrogate the notion of \"feminist rhetoric\" as merely a corollary to a masculinist tradition. Assignments will include critical essays and a visual rhetoric project on representations of women in the media and popular culture."
