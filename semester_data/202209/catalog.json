Reading the work of historians, anthropologists, critical theorists, knowledge-keepers, and activists, and examining sites such as national parks and infrastructure projects from the 19th century to the present, we will learn how efforts to define, manage, regulate, and exploit natural resources occur simultaneously with assaults on Native nations' sovereignty. We will explore how Indigenous peoples have cared for and defended their lands and human and nonhuman relatives despite continuous settler state violence and violations. We bring these discussions to current environmental issues in California, such as wildfire management and tribal nations' salmon restoration efforts.\u00a0\nOrigins of the New Right\nThis course studies the twentieth century origins and myriad manifestation of the\u00a0 \u201cNew Right\u201d in U. S. politics and culture. Starting in the 1920s with the rise of the second Ku Klux Klan and Christian Fundamentalism and homing in on the New Right\u2019s various stages of development from the Cold War to the present, we will examine film, news media, television, critical theory, and historical analyses.\nLatino/a Experience\nThis course will explore the history and experience of Latino/a immigrants in the United States, paying particular attention to how race, ethnicity, identity, politics, class, and gender influence the lives of Latino/a immigrants. We will also examine how they have influenced historical developments in different regions of the country, especially in terms of U.S. demographics.\u00a0\nBlack Literary History and the Archive\u00a0\nHow do we resurrect the lives of people who were considered unimportant, those whose contributions were dismissed and buried? What does the existing historical archive tell us about what is considered valuable and about what constitutes \"memory\"? This class examines the lives of two of the most important 19-century Black women writers, Harriet Jacobs and Harriet Wilson, as a means to develop the tools of literary recovery. As we expand the contours of the historical canon, we will also reflect on our own sense of the scope and shape of African American historical memory and the ways in which we organize history. How do we interpret religion, resistance, and labor activities that that fall \"outside\" of the most recognized narratives about African American experience? This class will take on these larger questions as we also engage in archival work in newspapers, census records, and beyond.\u00a0\nAfrican American Literature: Race/Gender/Sexuality\u00a0\nThis course is designed as a survey of African American literature. We will examine a multitude of genres, including: oral forms (spirituals, ballads, work songs), poetry, fiction, drama, and essays by authors such as: Phillis Wheatley, David Walker, Sojourner Truth, Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington, Ida B. Wells, W.E.B. DuBois, Langston Hughes, Nella Larson, Zora Neale Hurston, Jean Toomer, Jessie R. Faucet, Claude McKay, Richard Wright, Ralph Ellison, James Baldwin, Ann Petry, and Gwendolyn Brooks. Beyond strictly a \"greatest hits\" or \"major authors\" course, this class will also consider the ways African American writers interrogate complex categories of personal identity, which requires an in-depth investigation into the intersections of race, gender, sexuality, and socioeconomic class.

Both were modern political and industrial capitals, and both cities were vibrant catalysts for the work of cultural producers of all stripes - from artists, writers, filmmakers, musicians, and architects, to social theorists, scientists, psychologists, and political activists. Like magnets, these two cities drew people from across the European and American continents to their streets, offering the promise of cultural ferment and collective interaction, in cities each with their own traditions of avant-garde, modernist practice. But, people also moved between these two cities, creating networks and subcultures, sharing ideas and diverse cultural perspectives, in ways that radically transformed the cultural landscapes of 20th century Europe and America. As capitals, Paris and Berlin also offer views into the major social and political upheavals of the 20th century, culminating in the transformation of a networked, intercultural model of exchange between the two cities, in the 1920's and 1930's, into an actual occupation of Paris by Berlin in 1940. In this course, we will map out these varied structures of exchange by exploring the histories of the two cities through research and analysis of key urban sites, centers, and cultural producers who lived and worked there between 1910 and 1945.

Specific topics may satisfy different Core Program requirements.\nPhotography and Surrealism\nThis course engages with the history and theory of both photography and surrealism in the early to mid 20th century. Surrealist art and literature emerged out of the wake of avant-garde movements in the 1920s, yet have had a dramatic impact on the artistic practices and visual cultures of the 20th century. Self-consciously \"avant-garde\" practices of the 1920s and 1930s are one aspect that we will explore. But we will also attempt to understand how surrealist photographers also mined the visual tropes of advertising and publicity; fashion photography; modes of documentary and political work; film; and erotic photography to produce images that would arrest viewers' attention in new and complex ways. We will begin by exploring the historical avant-garde of the 1920s and 1930s in Europe and the US, but then open onto a more global approach to our understanding of surrealism and its legacy in the later 20th and 21st centuries. \u00a0Additional\u00a0Core Requirement Met: Global Connections (CPGC).\nSeeing Asian American Art\nSince it emerged on college campuses as a political term in the late 1960s,\u00a0Asian American\u00a0has described a group that is extremely heterogenous with as many differences as similarities among its members. Starting with questions that explore the uses (and abuses) of the rubric \u201cAsian American Art,\u201d this class will consider different contexts for work by Asian American artists and the ways that they can illuminate conversations about race in the U.S., the role that art can play in coalescing complex notions of community, the confluence of art and activism at crucial junctures over the past 50 years, and the nexus of art and its public reception both historically and at our contemporary moment. We will also chart intersections and parallels with contemporaneous African American, LatinX/ChicanX, and Feminist art movements.\u00a0Additional\u00a0Core Requirement Met: United States Diversity (CPUD).\nEncoding Equity: Art, AI, and the Aesthetics of Algorithmic Justice\nAlgorithms\u2014and the human agents who train them\u2014increasingly encode the structure of our world and lived experience. To inhabit an algorithmic present is to inhabit a space saturated with \u201cengineered inequity\u201d (Ruha Benjamin) and \u201calgorithms of oppression\u201d (Safiya Noble). Today, algorithms make determinations about housing, hiring, policing, incarceration, and the distribution of state social benefits. Despite their purported neutrality, AI systems have repeatedly been proven to exhibit biases that entrench and exacerbate structural inequalities. These models don\u2019t merely make predictions about the world: they actively produce it.\nYet, algorithmic decision-making unfolds in the opacity of the \u201cblack box,\u201d and engineers themselves can struggle to articulate the logic of its outcomes. This poses a quandary: on the one hand, AI generates far-reaching, material effects that impact individuals and communities on an unprecedented scale. At the same time, algorithmic operations are concealed within a \u201cblack box,\u201d hidden from view and made invisible.\nOver the last ten years, a growing cadre of artists has begun to confront this phenomenon in their practice. Their works stage interventions into AI systems, and envision how those systems might function otherwise. This class will attend to work by artists including Joy Buolamwini, Kate Crawford, Stephanie Dinkins, Mandy Harris Williams, Jennifer Moon, Mimi \u1eccn\u1ee5\u1ecdha, and Suzanne Kite. Their pieces will be paired with work in media studies and critical race studies by Ruha Benjamin, Safiya Noble, Cathy O\u2019Neill, Virginia Eubanks, Timnit Gebru, and others. Reading across these coordinates, the class will consider how contemporary artists render algorithmic bias visible and imagine speculative futures optimized for equitable outcomes.\nJapanese Art and Visual Culture in the Americas\nIn 2001, respected art historian Yoshiaki Shimizu contributed an article entitled \u201cJapan in the American Museums: But Which Japan?\u201d (Art Bulletin, 83:1 [March 2001],\u00a0123-134). The article questions what defines Japan and Japanese art by examining exhibitions of Japanese art at American museums as well as concordances and contradictions over the art of Japan among agents and players of art. The questions that the article posed are invigorating and valid nearly twenty years after its publication, but they deserve some updates. Inspired by Shimizu\u2019s thematic approach, this course will consider Japanese art and visual representations of Japan in the Americas and expand the scope of the art of this day. The class looks at Japanese art and artists in Mexico, engages more actively with Japanese and Japanese American art in Los Angeles, and critically embraces popular culture and subculture. Other topics to be examined include Japonisme, new and creative woodblock prints, folk craft and modern design, abstract painting and performance, and women artists in New York as well as dealers, collections, and collectors of Japanese art in Los Angeles. Additional\u00a0Core Requirement Met: Regional Focus (CPRF).\nMaterials and Materiality in Japanese Design\nThis course explores key materials and materiality in Japanese art and design.\u00a0Each class\u00a0is structured around a different type of\u00a0material or a combination of materials, such as rock, paper, wood, metal, earth, silk, and food. We will look at these materials or uses of them cross-historically rather than chronologically\u2014as an embodiment of spiritual/religious practice, representation of social class, identity of local community and environment, and/or artistic methodology, in addition to examining them simply as mediums and respective production techniques.\u00a0Additional\u00a0Core Requirement Met: Regional Focus (CPRF).\nArt and Nuclear Technology, Destruction, and Contamination\nThis course explores art and its relationship to nuclear technology, destruction, and contamination. The primary focus will be on postwar Japan but we will also investigate Disneyland and its link to the Atoms for Peace campaign, visual projects regarding nuclear accidents at Chernobyl and Fukushima in addition to the impacts of unclear technology, test sites, and nuclear waste isolation sites on image-making. Themes to be examined include Cold War culture and politics, art and disaster, trauma and memory studies, documentary art and art of witness, censorship, invisibility, activism, and dark tourism. Over the course of the semester, we will look at a variety of artistic genres and mediums, such as paintings, sculptures, photographs, installations, performances, animations and films, comics and picture books, designs, and public monuments as well as exhibitions and world expositions.

Over the course of the semester, we will investigate topics such as women artists and patrons; Buddhist conceptions of the feminine and women\u2019s devotional practices; performing \u201cwomen\u201d in theater; shifting ideals of beauty and the alteration of women\u2019s bodies; and the representation of gender in contemporary popular culture. Ultimately, students will develop critical tools for examining how women have been represented in visual culture and how they have exerted their own artistic agency in East Asia.",

Required for Art History majors to fulfill the Second-Stage Writing Proficiency requirement.\u00a0\nPerformance, Embodiment and the Dematerialization of Contemporary Art\nWhen many people think of \u201cArt\u201d they envision a painting, a sculpture, a photograph, a lithograph or woodcut, or even an artist\u2019s handmade book. Yet in the later years of the 20th century, artists drew on the disruptive works of the historical avant-gardes like Dada and Surrealism, as well as new ideas about the artist\u2019s place in the world, to create work that looked and behaved very differently than traditional media. In the years after 1960, artists questioned the definition of art (is it a thing or is it an action or an event?). In turn, artists grew invested in making work that disrupted the more traditionally passive relationship between viewer and work; instead, the spatial, temporal and cultural contexts of art works became part of the work itself. Coupled with the desire by many artists to displace art from the traditional confines of the commercial gallery system, as well as to call into question the realities of individual and collective embodiment and identities, the effect of these new approaches was to expand the definitions of art to include performance, body art, installation, and institutional critique. Thus, artists transformed, and often dematerialized the \u201cwork of art\u201d in favor of an art that could provoke action, communication, collaboration, and cultural critique. This seminar will enable us to explore these new modes of artistic practice in North America\u00a0 and Europe through provocative art historical and theoretical readings; student research projects; and activities and exhibitions at Oxy Arts and across Los Angeles.\nBuilding the \u2018American Pacific\u2019\nThis course examines modern and contemporary architecture of the \u2018American Pacific.\u2019 Students will investigate the historical, social, cultural, political, climactic, and technological factors that have influenced the development of architecture in Hawai\u2018i, American S\u0101moa, and Guam. Theoretical examinations about U.S. empire, race, and sovereignty allow us to challenge the very notion of an \u2018American Pacific\u2019 and frame our study of architecture as a complex interplay of evolving beliefs and meanings. An examination of Pacific Island spaces/places and their relationship to artistic endeavors by artists and architects reveal the ways in which indigenous and foreign identities influence the built environment. Students will engage with interdisciplinary and intersectional scholarship as we consider the architectural legacy of American expansion in the Pacific. Additional Core Requirement Met: Regional Focus.\nColonial Urbanism\u00a0\nIn this course, we will examine the spatial legacy of colonial cities. The focus is on colonial urban spaces and architectural projects that were manifestations of the political, economic, and social relationships between the colonizers and the colonized. In relation, the role of imperialism - as it transpired in both the colonies and colonizing societies of Europe and the United States - will reveal the ways in which the imperial imagination was visible in physical form. Through a range of case studies, including sites in former European and American colonies of Asia and the Pacific, as well as former imperial centers, such as London and Washington D.C., students will develop a theoretical toolkit for the critical study of urban colonial environments.\nGender and Sexuality in 20th Century Art\nThis seminar will explore the how issues of gender and sexuality have shaped the practices of visual artists in the US and Europe in the 20th century.\u00a0 We will investigate how artists have engaged directly with these issues in their art, and we will also consider how the field of Art History itself has been impacted by practices and stereotypes about gender and sexuality.

Course topic(s) change annually and will include off-campus hands-on work within the context of curatorial and exhibition practices. Course may be repeated for credit with a different topic.\nCollecting Value: Photography Archives of Los Angeles (4 units)\nThis course examines photography collections and archives of Los Angeles. Rather than looking at a single artist, time period, or approach to the photographic medium, we will look at the dynamics of photo collections held by institutions and individuals: how they are formed, what they contain, and which histories and narratives they uphold, counter, or exceed.\u00a0\nEach week, the class will visit a different collection across the city, exploring venues such as museums, libraries, galleries, and historical archives. We will also meet with contemporary artists who use and collect vernacular images in their practice. With each module, we will explore and complicate histories of the medium and set out to understand how institutions use photography collections to produce and reinforce cultural, historical, and economic value.\u00a0\nThe class will also correspond to the organizing of a forthcoming exhibition of Chinese photography from the 1980s and 90s, recently acquired by the Hammer Museum. The course will teach methodologies of curatorial practice with a focus on archival research, material preservation, and museum writing.\nThe Art of Describing: 17th- century Dutch Paintings and Drawings at the Getty Museum (2 units)\nTaught on site at the Getty Museum every other Friday, this class fosters a close study of 17th-century Dutch drawings and paintings. Examining the Getty\u2019s collection of Dutch art through the lens of Svetlana Alpers\u2019 groundbreaking book, The Art of Describing, this class explores the craft of representation and questions the narrative of the \u201cDutch Golden Age.\u201d\nEast Asian Gardens: China, Japan, Korea\u2014and California?\u00a0(4 units)\nWhat kinds of gardens have existed in East Asia, and what sorts of functions have they fulfilled? How have they engaged with broader visions of the cosmos, and how have they expressed such understandings? What happens to such gardens when they are translated into a cultural context very different from that in which they emerged? To answer these questions, this course, taught by a curator at the Huntington Library,\u00a0will take a broad view of the history of East Asian garden-making, examining images, texts, films, and gardens from the 2nd century BCE to the present. We will investigate hunting parks constructed as microcosms of empires, holey rocks that inspired dream-journeys to immortal realms, Buddhist paradises accessible in this-worldly estates, and textual fantasies of gardens of the mind. Taking advantage of\u00a0the Chinese and Japanese Gardens at the Huntington, this course will\u00a0also explore how such concepts have been put into practice in the physical spaces of these gardens, where the course will be held each week. Moreover,\u00a0we shall trace\u00a0the very different histories of these two gardens in order to gain insights into California's shifting relationship to East Asia over the course of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. In taking this course, students will ultimately gain an understanding of the diversity of garden forms in East Asia; familiarity with key concepts used in garden-making; practice with the skills of visual and spatial analysis, as well as cultural and historical contextualization, necessary to discuss gardens meaningfully; and experience with curatorial\u00a0strategies for making East Asian gardens accessible to diverse audiences.\u00a0The final project will involve developing an interpretive program for one section of the Huntington\u2019s gardens. This course meets on Friday, at the Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens.\u00a0Additional Core Requirement Met: Regional Focus and Pre-1800.\nTRUE GRIT: American Prints from 1900 to 1950 (2 units)\nThis seminar engages the exhibition and the J. Paul Getty Museum: \"True Grit: American Prints from 1900 to 1950\" which opens on October 15, 2019.\u00a0 This exhibition, drawn from local museums and a private collection in Los Angeles, provides a vibrant survey of early twentieth-century American printmaking. Compelling depictions by Peggy Bacon, George Bellows, Mabel Dwight, Edward Hopper, Martin Lewis, Kyra Markham, and John Sloan convey a broad view of American culture that include dance halls and boxing rings, skyscrapers and subways, parks and tenement apartments. Using innovative printmaking techniques, these American artists captured the gritty world around them and came to terms with modern life. This seminar will examine the nature of American printmaking in the early twentieth century. In addition to working with the Getty curator in planning the installation of the exhibition itself, topics will include evolving printmaking techniques and the evolution of a uniquely American subject matter.",

The course loosely follows a chronological order and a thematic framework. We will look at expansive materials, including colorful and playful woodblock prints (ukiyo-e) of natural disasters; prints and memorabilia of the Russo-Japanese war (1904-05); topography and the building of the Yasukuni Shrine and its exhibitions; the birth of the avant-garde and its relation to the Great Kanto Earthquake (1923); war documentary paintings and propaganda during WWII; atomic bomb photographs and memorials; reportage painting of the 1950s; anti-art and non-art movements of the expanded 1960s;\u00a0kawaii\u00a0(cuteness) and monstrosity in manga and animation; and socially engaged art about Fukushima.

There are several debates over who owns art of ancient civilizations like Greece and India. Do treasures like the Parthenon sculptures at the British Museum belong to Greece and should they be returned? Or should they remain in the museum where more people have access to them? This seminar will introduce students to laws enacted by UNESCO (United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization) to protect world, cultural, and national heritage, as well as to the examination of museum collecting policies in America. Specific cultural patrimony cases will also be examined and discussed. This seminar is for students who are interested in learning more about cultural patrimony, art law, and museums.",

Many contemporary artists are interested in incorporating sound into their projects but may not know how to approach and accomplish that integration. Because sound is ephemeral it can be used in an infinite number of ways to infer complex relationships. The challenge of using sound is that of translating ideas into the sonic medium and then reproducing that medium back into physical space. In this class students will learn about sound and discover ways to apply sound to express a deeper theoretical practice. Practical sound related techniques will be explored, as will their application through skills like deep listening, recording techniques for best capture practices, basics of the Digital Audio Workstation, and the use of sound reproducing systems.

Through a workshop format, local contemporary artists such as Dewey Tafoya, Shruti Purkayastha, will provide students with tools to develop projects that respond to dominant cultural narratives through graphic, performative, and interventionist strategies.\u00a0 Finally, students will learn how artists shake the foundations of various established institutional worlds and the definitions of art itself by moving away from these very institutions and spheres of practice and by creating their own structures for critical thought and praxis: building collectives, artist led spaces and in the case of School of Echoes,\u00a0becoming community organizers.",

Students will also learn about the connections between visual culture (like portraits) and science, including the developmental concepts of facial recognition, and representation recognition in infants and others; the neuroscience of mirror neurons and the biological basis of intersubjectivity as the foundation of ethical behavior; the philosophy of bioethics and notions of patient self-determination and agency; and the biology and physiology of social and cultural actions. Students will learn how looking at images has the power to physically change a person's body.

The course works through the premise that shadows and darkness do not just produce conditions that hide/conceal/obscure, but also that they can reveal and illuminate. Using photography, printmaking and hybrid sculptural forms, we will experiment with various artistic strategies that explore the nature of the contingent relationship between shadow and light. Our experiments will extend to questions and explorations that help us unpack social and cultural conventions and hierarchies that exist. Additionally, visits to studios and workshops around LA will enhance our hands-on activities. We will not only approach the theme of shadows through artistic practices, but also through philosophy, physics, literature and anthropology, so students from all disciplines are encouraged to enroll to maximize a diversity of ideas and fields of knowledge in our explorations.\nNeutral and Authoritative Knowledge\nthis course is for anyone who is interested in world-building, in teaching others to teach themselves (alongside other co-teachers/learners). we will design and implement the course objectives together\u2014laterally. we are all the students. we are all the instructors. no one is the expert but everyone knows some thing quite well. we will take what we know, make something from it, and likely call it \"art\" (or any other term that best suits your person). what will you bring to the table?\nA Sustained Environment: Understanding and Caring for Bio-Cultural Diversity\nThis course coincides with the unprecedented environmental and pandemic challenges of our time, bringing a new urgency to understanding the complex and dynamic interrelations between human culture and the natural environment.\u00a0\u00a0 Using embodied pedagogy to incorporate our bodies into the learning process, as well as indigenous, ecofeminist, and intersectional frameworks,\u00a0 we will analyze pressing ecological issues including climate change, nature rights,\u00a0 green capitalism, extractive economies, and environmental justice.

We will consider L.A., the second largest city in the U.S., as a case study of how organisms and the environment influence each other. Through reading, discussion, writing, gathering data, and exploration we will ask, what physical features define the Los Angeles environment? How have these changed over time, and what changes are likely to happen in the near future? What species of organisms (beyond palm trees, pets, rats, and cockroaches) inhabit this city?\u00a0 How does the physical environment affect urban species, and how do they, in turn, affect their environment? Students will develop proficiency in skills needed for the practice of biology, quantitative reasoning, and critical evaluation of scientific ideas and results. This course is an inquiry-based introduction to biological science in a format that includes both classroom activities and fieldwork. Field trips will occur during class time, with one required day-long field trip to be scheduled at the start of the semester.\nEcological Enhancement and Restoration\nBiological, ecological, and social views regarding need, methods, and effects of restoration and enhancement of ecosystems. Recent events from California and the rest of the world are discussed, focusing on marine and terrestrial ecosystems, invasive species, over-harvesting, industrial impacts on the environment, and methods of mitigating or repairing damages. Examples of discussions include: methods of combating over-harvesting in the Pacific Ocean; natural and anthropogenic methods of recovering from forest fires; oil platforms functioning as artificial reefs to help endangered species thrive; also, how does a nuclear generating station affect a giant kelp forest, and what can be done to mitigate those damages?\nPublic Health Biology\nThis introductory course will offer an integrative biological perspective on public health issues, highlighting specific diseases of viral, bacterial, and environmental origin, as well as the influence of social and economic disparity. We will explore specific examples, such as rising antibiotic resistance, cholera and hepatitis outbreaks, cancer, and diabetes, to illustrate biological principles required to understand infectious and non-infectious diseases of public health importance.\nTopics in Cancer Biology\nThis course will introduce students to the fundamentals of cancer biology. Topics will range from the biological origins of cancer to recent advances in diagnostics and therapeutics. Students will also be given a historical perspective of the bioethics surrounding cancer research and treatment.

Science is an endeavor that aims to categorically build knowledge about the universe in an objective manner. But our science not only informs society, it is also shaped by the needs and structure of our society. In this class, students will explore the potential societal impacts and determinants of their scientific interests through careful exploration of the literature. Through this exploration, students will learn to lead discussions about the intersections between science and society, critically evaluate the role of science in society, and develop skills in both oral and written scientific communication. Students will work with the professor to lead a discussion on a topic of their choice and will learn to write a \u201cbroader impacts\u201d section of a scientific grant, detailing how the science extends beyond the boundaries of the specific scientific endeavor to affect society. Each week we will explore a research topic in the scientific literature and accompanying literature on the societal impacts/determinants of that research.

Over the course of his lifetime, Du Bois wrote over 2000 bibliographical entries, across a range of genres, including: research monographs, plays, pamphlets, autobiography and biography, history, novels, poems, and popular press articles. At the same time, Du Bois utilized multiple methods, forms of data and evidence, and literary styles within and across texts. Nevertheless, in the domain of social science, and sociology more specifically, his work was intentionally marginalized. Yet while Du Bois was made a minor figure in American social science, he was a primary progenitor of the transdisciplinary field of Black, African American, or Africana studies and thus played a foundational role in circumventing the racial-colonial order of knowledge by attending to Black life and sociality. In this course, we will study the social theory of Du Bois by reading texts from across his vast corpus\u2014from his more formally social scientific writing and data visualizations to his creative projects like poetry and short stories. For the final project of the course, students will deploy a Du Boisian approach to social theory and analysis using more expressive forms (such as illustration, painting, film and video, poetry, music, photography, data visualization, short stories, or lyrical essays).",

Furthermore, women\u2019s roles in community health have been heavily shaped by gendered and racial constructions of the body, disease, and wellbeing.\u00a0 Thus, while the focus of the course is on the social history of women\u2019s health and healing, the theoretical framework of the course also aims to explore how ideologies of gender, race, class, and sexuality shape women\u2019s relationship to community health as both caregivers and health-seekers. The course is organized by a set of common themes that cut across time, space, and racial/ethnic boundaries in U.S. History.\u00a0 Themes include: spirituality and healing; work and health; sexuality and reproduction; activism for health justice.\u00a0 An important goal of this course is to make connections between historical studies of women and health and present-day community health activism. Much of the course and especially the community partnership component focuses on the leadership of women of color in shaping agendas for community well-being.\u00a0 In the past, course participants have worked with the organizations Black Women for Wellness, California Latinas for Reproductive Justice, Visi\u00f3n y Compromiso, and Promesa Boyle Heights. We will continue to work this year with women\u2019s health organizations and the Southern California Library on a Reproductive Justice community partnership. In addition, we will welcome several community health activists & scholars to the class as guest speakers.",

Do aesthetics foster a more harmonious or disharmonious national culture? Is disharmony ever important to progress? How does literature represent protests for social change that are often only possible outside the law, like the many freedmen and freedwomen escaping slavery and demanding the destruction of that system? How does this alter our understandings of what it means to be a fugitive? How can the fugitive fighting for freedom be distinguished from the unprincipled outlaw? From another perspective, we will consider how the complications of American society have altered certain traditional literary forms. While recent scholarship has addressed these questions in regards to early- to mid-20th century literature, this course will look back further, starting from the early 19th century to the very beginning of the 20th. We will complement the literature by reading relevant historical materials from the abolitionist movement, labor movements, government debates over Emancipation and Reconstruction, etc. The course will include literature from Frederick Douglass, Sojourner Truth, Walt Whitman, Ida B Wells, and Charles Chesnutt, amongst others, and will cover several genres, including: oratory, autobiography, political pamphlets, and short fiction.",

As a result, chemists have turned to the biological world for \"green\" solutions to these problems. The course will explore how microbes and enzymes are being exploited by the chemical industry for myriad processes, including the synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds, water treatment and purification, and for the generation of hydrogen as a source of clean fuels. The first part of the course will examine several industrial processes that have been using enzymes for decades to produce the final commercial product. Emphasis will be placed on the technical challenges required for large-scale production of the compound. Course content will then shift to the academic arena, exploring current processes that the chemical industry wishes to replace with biologically-based systems. The challenges associated with scaling-up these processes will be emphasized, drawing on the foundation laid in the first part of the course. Finally, based on these lectures, students will be asked to take a \"dirty\" chemical process and propose a \"green\" solution, and identify the technical challenges that must be surmounted. An important aspect of the project will be exploring the economic feasibility, as well as potential obstacles related to governmental policies.",

Recent successes in deep learning and AI have hinted that networks of simple units can produce surprisingly complex behaviors, and these models often even mirror the coding properties observed in the human brain. However, unlike artificial agents, humans excel at thinking creatively and reasoning about cause and effect, allowing us to behave flexibly in novel and ambiguous environments. What neural mechanisms support these behaviors? Which of these mechanisms are necessary for producing analogous capabilities in artificial agents?

Students will learn how to collect and organize data, and subsequently learn statistical techniques to prepare/clean it for analysis, such as imputation and dealing with outliers. In the process of data exploration, students will describe data, identify relationships between variables, and understand the structure of datasets. Visual representations of data will be used to discover patterns, and convey findings. The psychology underpinning understanding and reading visualizations will also be covered using a grammar of graphics approach.\nPrerequisites: COMP 131, COMP 181, or COMP 229\nHigh Performance Computing\nThis course covers high-performance computing, which refers to techniques, hardware, and software used to further speed up processing beyond a typical CPU desktop configuration. Students will learn to write code optimized for multi-core processors, employing parallelization strategies for hardware using OpenMP and MPI. Students will learn how to access and use Oxy's HPC cluster, as well as explore cloud platform solutions, tools, and programming languages used in both academic and industry environments.\nPrerequisites: COMP 229\nCategory Theory\nCategory theory is often regarded as the \u201cmathematics of mathematics\u201d and provides a natural context to discuss types of objects, their internal structure, and their relationships to other objects of the same or different contexts. Categorical descriptions naturally imbue systems with intrinsically algebraic structures, leading to a flexible descriptive framework for systems across many disciplines. Although the theory has its origins in pure mathematics (originally as the outgrowth of algebraic topology), applied scientists, engineers, and computer scientists have looked more and more towards category theory for modern approaches to solving and framing problems in technology and organization. This course will cover the basics of category theory, it's applications to Boolean logic, to databases and to the Haskell programming language.\nPrerequisites: COMP 149 or MATH 210, and\u00a0COMP 229",

The course asks, is mutual aid merely a short-term practice during mass emergencies or does it provide an alternate viewpoint for communal self-reflection and structural transformation? Can we think about using the principles of mutual aid to make lasting changes in social relationships and political structures?\u00a0\nIn this class we will use the concept of mutual aid to break down traditional binaries between surviving and thriving or pragmatism and idealism. We will think through the utopian ideal of mutual aid as a possibility for real political and social intervention. The literary works we will read allow us to imagine how the seemingly impossible becomes possible through the mundane uses of mutual aid. In addition to reading memorable works of literature in the historical contexts of Black and Brown and queer communities, this course will devote consistent attention to the mechanics of writing persuasive thesis-driven essays, an essential skill for succeeding at Occidental. Readings will include Richard Wright\u2019s short fiction \u201cDown by the Riverside,\u201d William Still\u2019s compilation The Underground Railroad, and Shani Mootoo\u2019s Cereus Blooms at Night.\u00a0Core Program Requirement Met: Global Connections (CPGC).\nImagining The Future\nThis course\u00a0on Anglophone literature, postcolonialism, and the African diaspora\u00a0proposes to critically investigate the concept of time. In particular, we will examine how time provides a crucial framework for how we imagine the future. We will take the seemingly self-evident concept of time and critically examine its intellectual history to consider how time serves a crucial function as a means of ordering our cultural, economic, and political ideas as well as our individual lives. Frameworks of history, modernity, and futurity rely on concepts of development and progress that are related to broader ideas of race and sexuality. In what ways do historical representations of time, development, and progress structure how we imagine the future? On whose behalf is progress being imagined? Where is progress located? What are the ideals of the future? Whose pasts are connected to the futures that we privilege? In considering these questions, we will examine a range of novels, films, empirical studies, and cultural theory that provide a complex portrait of how the future is imagined, especially from the perspective of those scripted out of its dominant narrative. We will engage with critical and literary approaches including Afrofuturism, queer futurity, the developmental novel, economic models, and science fiction.",

In this course we will read some of the central texts in which these thinkers developed their revolutionary models of analysis: historical materialism, post-metaphysical philosophy, and psychoanalysis. Though very different, what all three of these thinkers had in common was a rejection of the rational subject and with it the notion that commonplace social norms involved in knowledge, morality, and sexuality represented timeless and universal truths determined by a neutral subjectivity. Instead, each sought to explain how these norms were in fact social constructions that are best explained by analyzing the specific historical and sociological conditions in which they arose. For Marx, this project involved an analysis of how power and class relations contribute to the production of \u201cideology\u201d, for Nietzsche an investigation into the history and transformation of morality, and Freud the exploration of the unconscious. The result is a radical transformation of our understanding of subjectivity and a realization of the deeply contingent and malleable nature of human existence. We will investigate these theories by examining works of Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud within their contemporaneous contexts, drawing on the literature, art, and music of the time as well as more recent history and film as points of elucidation and comparison.",

Can it be relieved by material wealth, fame, success? For Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard despair was not a passing temporal condition but something that in itself points beyond itself to the possibility of its own overcoming. In doing so, despair, for Kierkegaard, forces open the crucial existential question: What does it mean to be a self? This course will examine this question by exploring changing conceptions of selfhood and despair from antiquity to modernity, moving from Achilleus\u2019 despairing rage in the Iliad to Dostoyevsky\u2019s depiction of the individual revolting against society in the Notes from the Underground and culminating in the seemingly irredeemable despair of Cormack McCarthy.

    "description": "Statesman, scientist, philosopher, poet, and in the words of Friedrich Nietzsche, \u201cthe last German before whom I felt reverence\u201d, this course will examine the life and work of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Widely regarded as the Shakespeare of German literature, Goethe\u2019s status as the major influence on the course of not only 19th century German but European literature was long simply assumed. Yet for a figure of this stature Goethe seems to embody a contradiction. No one quite knows what he stands for. Is Goethe the young Romantic of his youth; the aristocrat and politician of his middle period and founder of the coming of age novel, in which, as Hegel put it, \u201cthe hero loses his horns\u201d; or is he the mad scientist of his later works which he canonically etches into literary history in form of Faust? We will investigate these transformations and contradictions by asking how Goethe\u2019s almost obsessive quest for unity and form can be reconciled with the turmoil, change and disruption so emblematic of his life and work. We will do so by reading the canonical novels and dramas from his early, middle, and late periods, while also spending time with his scientific writings and the most beautiful poetry the German language has to offer. In short, we will examine Goethe not just as an author, but as a practitioner of the art of living. What does It mean to be young, mature, grow old and die? To fashion a self out of the turbulence and change that dominated not only Goethe\u2019s age, but our times as well? We will seek guidance in these questions by examining the interrelationships between Goethe\u2019s life, work and the age that came to be known as the Goethezeit.

    "description": "This course will investigate the concept of madness as both a social category and\u00a0one of the crucial terms of art and literature.\u00a0 On the one hand, madness often carries with it a negative connotation, as a statement or mental state beyond the realm of sense. Yet on the other, aesthetic theory has long considered madness\u00a0a necessary condition of great art. For the philosopher Immanuel Kant, the art of the genius must break the rules of style and\u00a0explode the bounds of the ordinary sense in order to be exceptional. Art, in this sense must necessarily push the boundaries of the normal, straddle the realms of\u00a0madness and sanity and, in doing so, transform the categories we use to understand the world. Thus, by seeing madness not as some eternal category, but as constructed and deconstructed in concrete contexts,\u00a0the dialectic of madness and genius forces upon us\u00a0the following questions: How does the concept of madness get constructed? Who gets to decide who is and isn't mad and why? Why is the creation of art so tightly bound up with concept of madness? What does this tell us about how we make sense of the world and the possibilities of changing our own forms of understanding? We will investigate these questions by reading works of literature and philosophy that directly and indirectly address issues of madness and its relationship to creativity. \u00a0Readings\u00a0will include works by Michel Foucault, Franz Kafka, Heinrich von Kleist, Honore de Balzac, Virginia Woolf,\u00a0Deleuze & Guattari, Goethe,\u00a0Adalbert Stifter, Immanuel Kant,\u00a0and Ralf Waldo Emerson.",

Rejecting what he saw as the tradition of western metaphysics and its quest for absolute knowledge, Heidegger's phenomenological\u00a0approach focused on an analysis of lived experience\u00a0and the structures that make that experience possible. Fundamental to this analysis are the ideas of finitude and fallibility. Human beings, for Heidegger, are never closed and completed, secure in their knowledge and understanding of themselves, but beings who are fundamentally concerned with their own being, who seek to determine themselves from within the complex social, historical, and interpersonal contexts into which they were thrown. As such, philosophy, for Heidegger, becomes interpretation, the attempt to interpret and reinterpret oneself and one's place within a changing and complex world, always with the possibility of failure. The course will investigate this project of \"existential hermeneutics\" through an in-depth investigation of some of Heidegger's major writings. The first half of the course will focus on a close reading of the first half of\u00a0Being and Time\u00a0while in the second half we will look at Heidegger's post war essays, his turn to \"poetic thinking\" and the legacy of Heidegger's thought on 20th century Continental philosophy.

But what was the Enlightenment?\u00a0This course will investigate the Enlightenment in all its complexities and contradictions. As an era defined by radical critique, Enlightenment thinkers rejected the authority of religion, tradition, and aristocracy, and sought to transform our understanding of nature, culture, and history by grounding these fields\u00a0on the transparent rational principles of freedom, progress, and universality. In doing this, the Enlightenment embroiled itself and us in a contradiction. It\u00a0both created the fundamental terms, ideals, and institutions\u00a0that frame our contemporary understanding of the world\u00a0while also establishing a discourse of universality and eurocentrism that serves as the object of our greatest critique. Yet far from being one thing, the Enlightenment also possessed the tools for its own self critique. Or, in the words of Johann Gottfried Herder, \"What is universal reason but a cover for our favorite, whims, idolatry, blindness and laziness?\" Following, Herder, Rousseau, and Goethe, this course will also investigate the alternative conceptions of nature, culture, and history that rejected the universalist and imperialist strand of Enlightenment thinking in favor of a dynamic, process-oriented understanding of history and nature as\u00a0eternally unfolding. With this conception, the Enlightenment perhaps offers\u00a0an alternative to help us in our quest to think beyond it.

By the end of the course, students will have a solid understanding of the historical, cultural, and intellectual context of the period we call The Enlightenment as well as the fundamental problems and questions that were addressed at that time. Students will also have a solid understanding of the divergent ways in which these questions were answered and the different conceptions of culture, history, and literature that arose out from these answers.

Throughout the course, we will examine the ambiguous relationship between \"forms\" and \"bodies\" in Western thought, and how the permutations of this nexus come to bear on a wide variety of different topics in the humanities, including: myths and theories of changing forms in nature (plants, clouds, animals); dynamic representations of gender, sexuality, and erotica; as well as figures of hybridity and the grotesque (human-animal hybrids, beasts, and monstrosities). More broadly, the course will explore the porous interfaces between ancient and modern poetics, myth and modernity, as well as the arts and sciences.",

They came into adulthood to realize that their parent\u2019s generation were if not perpetrators then\u00a0at least accomplices to one of the gravest genocides in human history, that they had enthusiastically endorsed a fascistic maniac, that the\u00a0country they inhabited\u00a0stood in ruins, bombed to the ground morally and physically, and that they now stood at the epicenter\u00a0of the cold war, half capitalist, half communist. From the perspective of the 68ers, the worst of all was that there had been no cultural\u00a0reckoning. With the conclusion of the Nuremberg trials and the prosecution of the elite Nazi administration, the majority of the population seemed content to simply to forget. For the 68ers that was not an option. Rather than view the WWII and the Holocaust as an aberration and horrific exception to German culture, the youth of the 68er generation demanded a revolutionary reevaluation of everything German. They asked: What factors, economic, social, cultural, and historical, led to this catastrophe? How can we come to terms with this past? And what vision of a transformed future could replace the old? The answer to these questions involved a three-step approach. A radical critique of the past and the structures of nationalism, patriarchy, heteronormativity, racism, and capitalism, which they believed were the foundational underpinnings of German fascism. Active political dissent that demanded change and culminated in the domestic bombings of the left-wing group the Red Army Faction. And a total re-conception of the norms of society, sexuality, and selfhood perhaps best represented in the Love Parade and the drugs, sex, and radical experimentation that fueled the raves and Berlin techno scene after the fall of the Berlin Wall.\nThis course will investigate the transformations of postwar German society in the literature, philosophy, film, photography, and art of the time. We will focus on the social critiques of the Frankfurt School of Critical Theory, political resistance in both the communist East and capitalist West Germany as well as the life in and relationship between the two, and the utopic visions of the postwar German left\u00a0as well as the success and failures of this radical political movement.

This course examines all aspects of this culture as it developed in the years 800-1600, in order to understand how these people viewed the world, and how this affected their lives and the development of Slavic culture. Communal village life, legends, folk genres and mythology, their sources, and their legacies, are examined. There is a close study of the phenomenon of the vampire, following its evolution from the Iron Age into 18th century Serbia, as a specific case study of how myths are born and persist. The ways in which pagan beliefs were incorporated into Christianity to create the \"dual-faith\" of the Russian peasant are examined, as well. In addition to analytical and historical texts, readings include tales of supernatural beings and phenomena, as well as testimony concerning encounters with the supernatural.",

Topics include Roman childhood and the Roman family, kinship relations, mothering and motherhood, child-rearing practices, children\u2019s experience, the death of kin and commemorative practices; the economic circumstances of ordinary Romans, the nature of work, the terms of lending and borrowing, the experiences and cultures of slave-holding and of enslavement; women\u2019s roles as girl (puella), girlfriend (amica), wife (matrona), prostitute (meretrix), and witch (venefica); sex, sexuality, and dirty songs; the people\u2019s entertainments, such as theater, games, gladiator shows, and popular literature; popular politics and the role of the crowd and common person in public life; the culture of soldiering and the experience of peoples at the borders of empire; popular religious phenomena and the appeal of prophets, priests, and holy men in such movements as Isis worship, Mithraism, and Christianity. The goal of the course is for students to emerge with a holistic understanding of the details of and scholarly theories about non-elite culture in the Roman world, and hence with a heightened ability to identify and critically analyze contemporary discourses about \u201clow\u201d versus \u201chigh\u201d culture, which most often remain entirely implicit.",

    "description": "The obsession with interpreting moral character based on physical (especially facial) features has endured since antiquity under the name of \"physiognomy.\" Strangely, interest in this esoteric art exploded during the \"Age of Reason,\" the Enlightenment, when it first became codified as an empirical science. Starting with the writings of Johann Caspar Lavater, whose monumental \"Physiognomic Fragments\" (1775-78) advocated physiognomy as a means of \"promoting human understanding and human love,\" this course will explore the widespread influence that the art of interpreting physical features had in the intellectual and artistic milieu of the 18th century, and, arguably, continues to exert in the modern day. We will examine physiognomy in the aesthetic, cultural, literary, and scientific contexts of the German Enlightenment, dealing with major figures such as Goethe, Lessing, Lichtenberg, Schiller, and Hegel, as well as the unprecedented boom in popularity of physiognomy\u00a0around 1900, when it was embraced by many prominent strands of German thought, from the \"philosophy of life\" (Nietzsche, Spengler, Kassner) and literary modernism (Rilke, Benn, Musil), to eugenics, criminology, and racial biology. Concluding with the rise of Nazism and Nazi attacks on modern art as \u201cdegenerate,\" the course will assess to what extent Walter Benjamin's thesis that \"[t]here is no document of civilization which is not at the same time a document of barbarism\" holds true for the historical trajectory of German thought. Topics include: the relationship between texts and images, theories and practices of interpretation, as well as the complicity of the arts and sciences in constructing theories of racial difference.

We will also interrogate the different ways in which writing has been theorized in modernity: as a self-referential symbolic practice; as a form of communication in which memory, experience and knowledge are produced, articulated and organized; and as a procedure of inscription in which language, technology, and bodily gesture are inextricably intertwined.

Furthermore, Bakhtin's approach to the text reveals prose fiction, and, to some degree, non\u00adfiction, as a unique medium through which language explores human consciousness in both time and space. In this course, Bakhtin's theories are studied in order to understand more deeply the significance of the novel, and novels are studied in order to better understand Bakhtin's theories. Works as diverse as Fyodor Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment, Venedikt Yerofeev's Moscow to the End of the Line, Umberto Eco's Foucault\u2019s Pendulum, and Manuel Puig's Kiss of the Spider Woman, are examined through the Bakhtinian lens in order to broaden the students' understanding of the text as a polyphonic phenomenon.

Epicurus, for example, wrote, \u201cThere is no use in philosophy, unless it casts out the suffering of the soul.\u201d In this course, we examine the therapeutic programs offered by various ancient philosophical schools: the Peripatetics (followers of Aristotle), Stoics (followers of Zeno of Citium), Epicureans (followers of Epicurus), Skeptics (two schools, one descending from Plato\u2019s Academy and the other from Pyrrho), and finally the Christian philosophy of Augustine of Hippo, which was informed by but also broke decisively with the Greco-Roman philosophical tradition that had preceded it. In order to understand the therapeutic programs of these schools, we shall first have to understand each school\u2019s account of human nature (\u201canthropology,\u201d in its original sense), of the mind or soul (\u201cpsychology,\u201d in its original sense), and of the purpose or \u201cend\u201d of human existence (\u201cethics\u201d). Each school\u2019s answer to the question of why we suffer and how we might find psychological peace\u00a0only makes sense in light of that school\u2019s beliefs about what it is to be human, what is the nature of the mind/soul, and what is the purpose of life. Our source materials in this investigation will include classic texts in ancient ethical thought: Cicero\u2019s Tusculan Disputations, a literary masterpiece cast as a dialogue among prominent Romans who had sought refuge in the countryside as the end of the Roman republic unfolded; Seneca\u2019s On tranquility of mind, which takes the form of a letter to his friend Serenus, who had sought him out to find relief from his distress; and the third book of Augustine\u2019s Confessions, which details the author\u2019s suffering under the afflictions of lust and the apparent paradox of his perverse delight in his own misery.",

Pompey\u2019s military leadership had been the republicans\u2019 last hope of preserving Rome\u2019s constitutional order in the face of the dictatorial ambitions of Julius Caesar, who had in effect declared war on his own country in 49 BCE when he brought his army across the Rubicon river into Italy from Gaul.\u00a0\nSome Romans\u2014including the statesman, orator, and philosopher Marcus Tullius Cicero\u2014resisted Caesar with the pen, not the sword. In works such as On the Republic and On the Laws, Cicero articulated and urged upon his fellow citizens the merits of republican government, its basis in popular sovereignty, and the moral and political virtues of the rule of laws not men. A group of republican conspirators seeking\u00a0to restore the old order assassinated Caesar in 44 BCE. They were\u00a0in turn\u00a0destroyed by Caesar\u2019s would-be heirs. In the tumult, Cicero was assassinated by the Caesarian faction for his political speech and activism.\nCicero\u2019s writings and their influence survived his assassination and have inspired opponents of tyranny and proponents of self-government for over 2000 years. In this course, we engage with the legacy of Roman republicanism, and its historically unprecedented regime of rights, laws, and constitutional norms. We read foundational texts by Cicero and the Roman historian Livy as well as by later political theorists who drew inspiration from them, such as Machiavelli, who re-introduced the theory of republican government into a Renaissance Europe ruled by princes in his 1517 treatise Discourses on Livy, and John Adams (the \u201cAmerican Cicero\u201d), whose 1787 work Defence of the Constitutions of the United States of America owed much to Ciceronian thought\u00a0and made the Constitution that we have today\u2014the oldest constitution in the world, and one that many perceive as now under threat\u2014the world-changing document that it has proved to\u00a0be.",

It is motivated by the conviction that we do interpretive justice to the accomplishments of African American writers when we attempt to understand the tradition(s) they conceive their work to be intervening in.\nAfrican American literature was born with the publication of Phillis Wheatley\u2019s Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral, in 1773. The book evinces a deep knowledge of Latin and Latin literature, which it turns to its own emancipatory end. Indeed, Wheatley secured her freedom on the strength of the book.\nEngagement with classical texts offered Wheatley and other African American writers of every era an opportunity to access, deploy, and transform a widely shared treasury of meanings, ideas, images, tropes, genres, and styles in order to create unique works of great artistic power, capable of opening up newly imagined ways of being for themselves and their readers. In addition to Wheatley, we shall explore the classical interactions of poets such as James M. Bell, Mary Livermore, Frances Ellen Watkins, and Robert Hayden and prose writers such as David Walker, William Sanders Scarborough, and W. E. B. Du Bois.\nTo experience the artistic power of these works as their authors intended, we must understand the aesthetic and literary contexts and tradition(s) in which they worked, for context and tradition are the foundation of a work\u2019s meaning. To this end, we shall read alongside African American literary creations some of the Greek and Roman literary works to which they respond. For when we see clearly how a poem by, for example, Phillis Wheatley, responds to an ode by the Roman poet Horace\u2014himself the son of a freedman\u2014we grasp more fully the unique aesthetic, moral, and intellectual power of her poem. To see how Horace\u2019s poetry could communicate to Wheatley is to see how Wheatley\u2019s poetry can communicate its emancipatory power and promise to us in our own time.",

But one form of literature, at least, has always known otherwise. For no matter what philosophy, religion, ethics, or the law try to tell us, comedy will never let us forget that we exist, in this world at least, in and through our bodies. The bodies of comedy, however, unlike the bodies of science, art, or athletics, are neither orderly, nor inspiring, nor ideal. The comedic body is unruly, excessive, needy, offensive\u2014in a word, impolite. What is special about comedy, however, as this class will endeavor to show, is that it encourages us not to despair over our shared condition of gross embodiment, but rather to unite ourselves around it. Comedy creates community from the shared experience of our bodies\u2014 from our corpulent, crapulent, concupiscent corporeality. Having no interest in the maintenance of an ideal \"body politic,\" comedy rejoices in the humble togetherness of a \"body impolitic.\" Though this course will aim to establish a history of comedy from the ancient Greeks and Romans to the Medieval, Renaissance, and Restoration eras (and beyond), it will also make constant reference to modern comedic phenomena; the sit-com, the rom-com, the stand-up, the parody, and the roast\u2014to name but a few.",

Traditionally, of course, the myth of Ulysses has been understood as a rather sentimental myth of nostos, or \"homecoming\": the hero, forced by fate into hateful foreign places, finally wins his way back to the security, stability, and contented self-sufficiency of his own native land. Or so the story goes. In this course, however, we will test the thesis that something more like the opposite of this interpretation may hold true. It may be, in other words, that the wanderings of the Ulysses figure (whether through the seas of the Mediterranean, the streets of Dublin, or the isles of the West Indies) work not so much to affirm the self\u00ad-sufficiency and comfort of home, as to trouble and destabilize it. What the heroes of these works might finally come to understand - and may even rejoice in - is not the idea that there is \"no place like home,\" but rather that, in the end, it is only within a certain placelessness that we are ever really \"at home\" at all.",

    "description": "In the 6th century BCE, certain Greek thinkers (who have since come to be known as \"philosophers\") put in motion a conceptual distinction decisive for the cultural and intellectual history of the West: the division of the soul (psyche) from the body (soma), and more generally, from the \"flesh\" (sarx). By the 4th century BCE, Plato seems to have concluded that philosophy must eschew any interest in the flesh, inasmuch as flesh (whatever it may be) cannot yield to precise, philosophical investigation. Perhaps even more crucially, Plato stipulated that flesh cannot and should not be the basis of a politics, as it is only philosophical insight, in its disciplined refusal of the lure of the flesh, that could serve as the ground of genuine political communion. From here it was but a short step to conclude that poetry (and of course, \"art in general\"), entangled as it was with the body, could have little meaning or import for the practice of either politics or philosophy.\nInfluential as these weighty pronouncements have been on the development of Western thought, resistance to them, it should be noted, was almost immediate--beginning perhaps with the work of Plato himself! In this course, we shall examine the ways in which literature and art, as a \"poetics of the flesh,\" offers us a practice as rigorous, and productive, as any philosophy focused on\u00a0abstract\u00a0forms. We shall then consider what such a poetics of the flesh might be able to offer philosophy itself as an intellectual discipline. Finally, we shall engage with recent theories concerning the way in which authentic political community might rest not on the eschewal of the flesh, but on its deliberate and thoughtful \"incorporation\" (pun intended).\nThe first half of the class will focus on older material (certain Ancient Greek and Roman poets, Plato, Aristotle, the Old and New Testament, as well as some medieval writers and thinkers); the second half of the class, however, will turn to the work of more recent poets and theorists of the flesh, with a particular emphasis on the\u00a0investigations of Jean-Luc Nancy into the significance of the arts for what he calls the \"sense of sense.\"",

The city, as we experience it today, is the product of multiple historical, cultural, and social forces. Over the course of the semester, we will consider how cities have been shaped by these forces, as well as how they, in turn, shape our own experience and understanding of culture, history, and social practices. In an era of increasing globalization and mobility, the role of the metropolis continues to evolve and expand. As we consider representations of the city in a variety of films and novels from around the world, including some from our own city of Los Angeles, we will interrogate the ways in which the city has played a formative role in how we imagine life in the contemporary moment. In what ways has the city become a vehicle for the production of culture? How does life in the city serve to normativize certain notions of what it means to live in the modern world? How does life in rural spaces complicate representations of modernity that take the city as their norm? Does the city promote accessibility, or, alternatively, does it rigidify codes of exclusivity?

We will begin the semester by exploring theoretical representations of resistance movements within critical legal theory and social movement theory. We will look at different conceptualizations of power and consciousness in our analysis of resistance, and the role of each in instigating resistance movements. We will then turn to an analysis of the law as a tool of collective struggle by studying and comparing the implicated rights and site-specific needs, objectives, strategies, and outcomes of each case study. We will look at the different ways these resistance movements may use the law to mobilize followers, to frame and address collective grievance, to advance and develop legal protections for marginalized groups, and to connect their localized struggles with global ones by redefining and reimagining concepts of dignity and freedom. Each case study will also provide us with an opportunity to explore the relationship between the law, state-sponsored violence, and repression of resistance movements. We will also examine the role and influence of legal advocacy organizations in contemporary resistance movements, and evaluate the current limitations of the law in contributing to social change. How do rights-based claims (e.g. indigenous rights, water rights) obscure the relationship between law and power, injustice, and structures of oppression? Can the law be a useful catalyst for change, and/or is it necessarily a supplement to grassroots organizing and mobilizing efforts? To examine these concepts and tensions, we will look at legislation and legal practices, landmark court cases, and critical scholarship related to our case studies. Among the resistance movements we will likely study are: Brazil's Landless Rural Workers Movement; indigenous resistance movements in North and South America, including resistance to the Dakota Access Pipeline and the Agua Zarca Hydroelectric Dam in Honduras; and different phases in the movement for black civil rights in the United States.",

    "description": "This seminar will engage important topics and issues in Critical Theory and Social Justice. All CTSJ faculty will participate in order to facilitate an interdisciplinary engagement with complexities and nuances of these topics. Students from other CTSJ courses will be invited to participate in the construction of discourse around the topics. May be repeated for credit when offered with\u00a0a different topic.\u00a0Different topics may fulfill different Core Requirements.\nBlack Popular Culture // The Black Digital Age\u00a0\nThis class is part of a series that takes up black popular culture as a social formation structured by both the shifting conditions of antiblackness and black objection in the 20th and 21st centuries.\u00a0 Rather than engage black popular culture as a representational form, the course queries the peculiarity of blackness\u2019 cultural popularity within a society where black people remain disproportionately available to gratuitous violence and early death.\u00a0 As such, the course interrogates the ways in which the mainstream US popular culture economy is sustained by a deeply contradictory fascination with black bodies, black sociality, and black repertoires of performance within an antiblack society and argues that consumption of black life and black expressions is a modality of the ways in which blackness is put to use under white supremacy.\u00a0 The course is particularly concerned with how the audio-visual is a poignant site at which visual fixations on and pathologizations of blackness collide with black peoples\u2019 expressions of objection, self-articulation, activism, and the forging of social space. In this light, this iteration of the course, queries the possibility of the \u201cBlack Digital Age\u201d as the proliferation of black expressions within the 2010 to present moment in the audio-visual (TV, film, and videography, including Scandal, Moonlight, Insecure, Queen & Slim, Native Son, Lemonade, When I Get Home, When They See Us, Fences, Random Acts of Flyness, and countless others) and social media (Youtube, Twitter, and Instagram) realms. We ask, what political, social, and historical developments in this moment have facilitated such a proliferation of black productions within the audio-visual; what is the social, political, and historical impact of these black productions; how have black artists reconfigured black visuality as a site of desire, pleasure, restitution, and power in the face of antiblack racism as visual degregation of blackness; and how might our social criticism and genuine engagement with these texts extend the project of black life, objection, and self-articulation in the face of ongoing antiblackness? Core Requirement Met: United States Diversity.\nSocial\u00a0Movements/Representational Forms\nIn this course, we will examine the competing advocacy within social movements for documentary, fiction, journalism, lyric, abstraction, and other representational forms. For each social movement or political issue that we cover, students will compare multiple modes of representation, considering why they emerged, what their strengths and weaknesses were at each specific conjuncture, and what significance they have for future struggles. We will begin with some theoretical grounding and then proceed via a set of case studies. These may include: debates about realism vs. modernism in the Frankfurt school; testimonies in Latin America; confession vs. experimentation in feminist literature; reportage vs. the essay in journalism; and slogans, songs, and posters in queer activism.\nBlackness, Gender, and Sexuality\nIn this course, students will deconstruct, critique, and reconsider our notions of \u201cgender\u201d and \u201csexuality\u201d by thinking deeply, creatively, and rigorously about the ways in which blackness has been both central to modern conceptions of gender and sexuality and marked as the standard of sexual and gendered deviance. Students will consider \u201cgender\u201d and \u201csexuality\u201d as historical, socially produced, and mutable categories that are co-constituted by structures of power including race, capitalism, and chattel slavery. Importantly, the course will focus on identifying the historical conditions and structures of power that have differently gendered black bodies in the Americas. By considering the particularities of black gendering, the course will identify how notions of gendered and sexual deviance and availability to antiblack violence have been central to producing black people as a population. Through concepts such as flesh, ungendering, availability, and queerness, students be able to unpack how black bodies are gendered in terms and social relations that are in excess of a binary and are not analogous to other racialized bodies. Finally, by looking at popular and cultural objects, the class will analyze how contemporary\u00a0 raced and gendered structures of power affect black people and communities.  Core Requirement Met: United States Diversity.\nCritical Theory and Psychopathology\nThis experimental interdisciplinary course considers the intersection of Critical Theory and psychopathology. The goal is to examine the ways in which central insights in Critical Theory might reorient our perspective on, and interventions against, mental disorders. By way of contemporary case studies, we will examine the directive to \"care for the self\" (Michel Foucault), the mandate \"you must change your life\" (Peter Solterdijk), the problems of death (Jacques Derrida), the work of forgiveness (Derrida), and the anguish of perversions (Georges Bataille). We will also re-read chronic pain (Friedrich Nietzsche), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (Sianne Ngai), Gender Dysphoria (Judith Butler), and Intermittent Explosive Disorder (Slavoj Zizek). We anticipate the emergence of a broader more powerful view of madness.\u00a0Core Requirement Met: Global Connections.",

Different topics may meet different requirements.\nHumming in the in Between: Black Southern Organizing and Sound\nThis interdisciplinary\u00a0course examines the politics of sound in how moments in between resistance and deep oppression are documented and understood when considering Black Southern pursuits of liberation. This course will challenge students to engage in familiar\u00a0political moments in a sensory capacity, challenging understandings of political consciousness, movement success, and power building. In this course, sound will be used as a\u00a0 critical field to examine the voices that will\u00a0produce the sound as they construct and navigate constructions of democracies and oppressive state actions that have entangled their Blackness to a dance of freedom and coercion. Thinking through a sonicscape allows for an investigation of the overlapping of the institutional and lived realities of Black rural Southerners.\nWriting Trauma\nThis is a writing-intensive course with a focus on marginalized identities and social justice. It examines the process of writing with, about, and through trauma. During the semester, we will\u00a0investigate\u00a0the origins of trauma through a social justice lens and how writing can be a transformative political act. We will examine trauma and writing as they pertain to current events. Critical writing is an integral part of this course.\nIndigenous Literature as Decolonial Praxis\nThis course will examine Indigenous literature as a form of political cultural production. Using settler colonialism as a context, the texts under examination will be understood as assertions of Indigenous sovereignty. As a result, readers' will come to understand Indigeneity and Indigenous peoples more broadly. By examining primarily 20th and 21st century texts, a contemporary view of Indigenous epistemologies, including ideas of belonging, kinship networks, violence, etc., and social justice struggles will emerge as relevant to current decolonial efforts. This class counts as a methods class for the CTSJ major.\nWhite Queer Theory\nThis course critiques the ways in which queer theory and politics of the late 20th and 21st century have been a profound site through which whiteness has been able to reproduce and proliferate in the context of the neoliberal incorporation of raced, sexed, gendered difference into structures of capitalism and the US nation-state.\u00a0 As such, students will engage both the so-called critical texts of white American queer theory and texts from queer indigenous studies, black queer studies, women of color feminisms, and queer of color critique along with the burgeoning fields of black trans studies and trans of color critique that have rigorously critiqued the limits of the so-called critical texts to think [critically] about their reproduction of whiteness and the ways in with their thinking of queerness does not encapsulate the ways in which indigeneity, blackness, and other racialized formations are marked as sexually deviant, non-heteronormative, and queer, both as sexual identities and as populations.\u00a0 In order to thoroughly interrogate these proliferations students will engage a variety of texts that include theory, history, political movements, and popular culture \u2014 texts include the work of Foucault, Judith Butler, Glee, Paris is Burning, #ItGetsBetter, the phenomenon of Milo Yannopoulos (aka Milo Hanrahan), Christine Jorgensen, and the white queer antiblack backlash against the simultaneous passing of prop 8 in California and the election of Barack Obama as the first president; and the work Cathy Cohen, Qwo-Li Driskill, Jasbir Puar, Scott Morgensen, C. Riley Snorton, Roderick Ferguson, and other scholars who have reframed questions of queerness and its intersections with whiteness, settler colonialism, and racial capitalism through frameworks such as homonationalism, settler homonationalism, trans necropolitics, and the queerness of blackness.\u00a0This class counts as a methods class for the CTSJ major.\u00a0Core Requirement Met: United States Diversity.\nWhiteness\nThis course seeks to engage the emergent body of scholarship known as Critical White Studies (CWS). This scholarship is designed to deconstruct the racial category \u201cwhite.\u201d\u00a0 We will examine the historical, legal, economic, gender, and aesthetic constructions of whiteness.\u00a0 Particular attention will be paid to the problem of blackface. We will also critically examine CWS. Core Requirement Met: United States Diversity.\nChattel Slavery and Its Afterlives\nThis course introduces students to the key theoretical and historical frameworks that elucidate the particularities of chattel slavery in the Americas both in its \u201cpre-emancipation\u201d manifestations and as, Saidiya Hartman notes, the ongoing machinations of captivity, domination, and dispossession by which antiblackness continues to structure and suture the world. \u00a0 In this course, the particularity of chattel slavery emphasizes how the economic and social function of the enslaved as laborer and commodity, the centrality of blackness as a fungible and immutable category of the enslaveable (non)human, and the massive global function of chattel slavery as the foundation of capitalism distinguishes this formation from other historical or regional structures of slavery, labor exploitation, trafficking, and racialized domination.\u00a0 Furthermore, students will be challenged to confront the ways in which the de jure abolition of chattel slavery (in 1865 in the US and across the Americas in the 19th century) has been a historical, legal, and structural misnomer that does not capture the ways in which societies, economies, and legal structures adapted to sustain rather than eradicate the global dependence on black subjection. Students will engage the prison industrial complex, abandonment & deindustrialization, policing, geographic containment, the consumption of blackness as popular culture, formations of neoliberalism, and antiblack state and state-sanctioned terror as contemporary formations of chattel slavery\u2019s afterlives.\u00a0The course engages the geographic contexts of the US, Jamaica, Haiti, and other parts of the Caribbean.

The multi-disciplinary and interdisciplinary perspective of this introductory survey course is in keeping with an emerging global consensus that measures of poverty go beyond income and consumption, and that poverty reduction requires bridging disciplines (Economics, Political Science, History, Anthropology, Geography) and methods (quantitative and qualitative, observational and participatory). The course will be divided into two parts. During the first part of the course, students will be introduced to the main theoretical ideas on social, economic, and political development that have informed the field's evolution. This will familiarize students with fundamental thinking on development, as well as the frontiers of research.

The European Union (formerly the European Community) and its 28-member states are thus also central to this subject, as it encapsulates the development of key political institutions, civil society, representation, and economics on the continent. We will thus explore what has been accomplished by European integration (e.g., maintaining peace, increasing mobility, granting human rights, enhancing multilateralism, and strengthening democracy), as well as the considerable challenges that lie ahead (e.g., \"Brexit\", eastern enlargement, the stability of the Euro, the integration of refugees, and the rise of populist parties).

How religious, national, linguistic, and ethnic nationalisms inform conflict and cooperation within the region.\u00a0\nIn the context of these three themes, we will explore the following regional issues with global implications: (1) the Arab-Israeli conflict - the flash point of conflict in the Middle-East, the Arab-Israeli conflict can only be understood on the basis of an informed appreciation of its historical and ideological underpinnings, (2) Iran - the Iranian revolution had an enormous impact on regional and international affairs. Current unrest within Iran is perhaps a harbinger of yet another radical shift in Iranian politics, and (3) domestic upheaval in the region, as seen in the Arab uprisings of 2011-2012.\nDespite this being an \"IR\" class, on-the-ground social and political movements (\"domestic,\" yet transnationally informed) have an enormous impact on the region's politics.

Despite improvements in the health status of low- and middle-income countries over the last half-century, the challenges to advance global public health remain daunting. What are the sorts of strategies these actors have used in addressing such health issues as: HIV/AIDS, malaria, unsafe food and water, tobacco use, and others? What is the role of human rights in addressing the underlying determinants of ill-health? The course will present basic concepts for understanding global public health, including morbidity; mortality; demography; epidemiology; and the political, social, and economic determinants of health. We will utilize a case study method to examine successful and less successful efforts to improve global health and to debate enduring political, economic, social, and cultural controversies in the arenas of global health.

This field is, fundamentally, about both the use of force by, and violent conflict among, states and non-state actors. The course will be guided by general theoretical questions regarding security: how does violent conflict or competitions shaped by the lurking possibility of such conflict affect international relations and individual societies? How has the role of violent conflict in international politics changed since the end of World War II? What is the nature of security today? These general questions will frame explorations of more specific strategic questions. Such questions will include: how do states and non-state actors use force to persuade their enemies to take (coercion), or refrain from taking (deterrence), a particular action? How can nations best prepare to prevent violent conflicts or to win them if they occur? What has determined success and failure and the intensity, duration, and consequences of military action? We will have a particular focus on emerging transnational security issues, intra-state security, and the relationship between security development and state failure.

While America's hegemonic status in terms of hard (military) power remains undisputed, China's gross domestic product may surpass that of the United States as soon as 2017. This course is a seminar on Asian security, covering military security, non-traditional security, and economic and political security, among other dimensions. The course surveys the Asian region, with particular emphasis on Southeast Asia (the ASEAN countries, particularly Cambodia Burma/Myanmar, Thailand, and Singapore) and Northeast Asia (China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan). The material is divided into three parts. The first provides an overall introduction and overview of Asian security and focuses on the foundations of what was thought to be the Asian Miracle (created in part from a U.S. security umbrella), just as the Washington Consensus rose to prominence. It takes students through the Asian Financial Crisis and its aftermath. Part two of the class focuses on Japan, South Korea, China, and Taiwan. It describes their development trajectories and security arrangements. Part three uses China as a platform to examine other parts of Asia not already covered, such as: China's relationship with Southeast Asia, and the political economy of non-traditional security, in particular the region's experience with Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza.",

    "description": "In many countries, the subject of LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) rights has entered the political discourse with unprecedented speed and suddenness. For an issue that was most often relegated to the private sphere, the rapid global expansion of LGBT rights, as well as changes in public opinion toward LGBT people, has been nothing short of remarkable. This course is designed to gain leverage on the processes that explain such changes by surveying an eclectic literature on comparative and transnational LGBT politics: from social movements to normative change in international relations. For these fields of study, the changes addressed above pose several important questions. It is no coincidence, for example, that dozens of countries now grant some form of same-sex unions, and understanding transnational politics helps us understand why. Specially, we will ask: What factors have facilitated the mobilization of LGBT people? Why and how have public opinion and state laws towards LGBT people changed differently across various countries?\nTo find answers to these questions, we will analyze the political history of a movement that has captured the world\u2019s attention, and one that has moved a marginalized group from the political periphery to the center of public debate and contestation. We will take an in-depth empirical look at movements representing LGBT people and their successes/losses\u2014as well as those of their opposition\u2014across time and place. The first portion of the course will begin with the organized movement\u2019s earliest roots in early 1900s Europe, followed by suppression during WWII, and then the homophile movement of the post-war period. The remainder of the course explores the public manifestation of LGBT identities that grew out of the Stonewall\u2019s gay liberation politics, mobilization around the HIV crisis, and the domestic and international politics surrounding the spread of LGBT rights and recognition in contemporary times.

Its parameters have been broadened considerably and now encompass longer term efforts to assist developing countries in enhancing durable structures conducive to peace and democratic stability and the targeted use of development cooperation. Combining theoretical/conceptual and practical concerns, and drawing from case studies of recent conflicts, the ultimate objective of the course is to identify feasible short-term and long-term conflict prevention strategies and tools and to develop practical suggestions to move from a culture of reaction to a culture of prevention. More specifically, the course will deal with: (1) the evolving meaning of prevention as it was understood in the Charter of the United Nations and subsequently shaped by the changing causes and nature of conflicts; (2) the main actors in conflict prevention against the backdrop of UN institutions; (3) the tools and practice of \"operational\" prevention (i.e. early warning, mediation, sanctions, peace operations, peace enforcement, and the role of regional organizations); (4) the tools and practice of \"structural\" prevention (good governance and democracy, mainstreaming human rights and gender, meeting post conflict reconstruction, and addressing the root causes of conflict); and (5) the significance of the emerging norm of the \"responsibility to protect\".

Looking forward: What growth in the US economy can be expected for the next couple of decades compared to the rest of the world? How do the forces of immigration and technological change affect jobs in the US and abroad? How does globalization affect which jobs are more-or-less isolated from foreign competition, and which are constantly at risk of moving abroad?",

Students who will be off campus in the Fall of their senior year must contact the department chair by the end of their junior year to arrange a substitute senior seminar.\u00a0\nEconomics of Education\nThis course uses an economic lens to study educational systems, human capital acquisition, and education policy.\u00a0 It considers the education system at large, ranging from early childhood education, through secondary and post-secondary education.\u00a0 The course develops a theoretical framework for why and how education levels differ across individuals, considering both signaling and productivity margins.\u00a0 It covers the basics of public education financing and examines how the way that education is financed determines educational quality.\u00a0 The course will discuss various public policy topics surrounding education topics which may include include: the value of early childhood education, the importance of quality instruction, peer effects, high-stakes testing, major-choice, and more.\u00a0 The course will build on foundational economic concepts and ask students to connect economic theory and empirical research towards understanding our system of education.\u00a0Not open to students who have taken ECON 330.\nPrerequisite: ECON 251 and ECON 272 (may be taken concurrently).\nFirm-Level International Trade\u00a0\u00a0\nThis seminar studies firm behavior in the international economy and how it is influenced by government regulations and international trade agreements. Topics discussed include the decision to export, foreign direct investment, outsourcing/offshoring, GATT/WTO and various trade agreements. We use modern trade theory to analyze firm decision-making and also learn how firms engage in international commerce from empirical studies and\u00a0case studies. Not open to students who have taken ECON 352.\nPrerequisite: ECON 272 (may be taken concurrently) and ECON 250.\u00a0\nIndustrial Organization\nThis course introduces the field of Industrial Organization, which is the study of firms in markets. We will analyze the acquisition and use of market power, strategic interactions among firms, and the role of government competition policy. Our approach will blend two alternative, but complementary, methodologies: theoretical modeling of strategic firm behavior and industry equilibrium, and the factual detail found in case studies of specific industries. Not open to students who have taken ECON 302.\nPrerequisite: ECON 272 (may be taken concurrently) and ECON 250.\u00a0\nMacroeconomic Policy since the Great Depression\nIn the current\u00a0economic\u00a0climate, how can\u00a0macroeconomic\u00a0policymakers help the U.S. economy?\u00a0 This course analyzes the current\u00a0macroeconomic\u00a0policy\u00a0challenges facing the United States from the vantage point of modern\u00a0macroeconomics\u00a0and\u00a0economic\u00a0history.\u00a0 Students will develop a sense for how macroeconomists conduct research and make\u00a0policy\u00a0recommendations.\u00a0 The course focuses on the major developments of U.S. monetary and fiscal\u00a0policy\u00a0since the Great Depression and the role of history in guiding contemporary\u00a0macroeconomic\u00a0policy\u00a0decisions and debates.\u00a0Not open to students who have taken Economics 351.\nPrerequisite: ECON 251 and ECON 272 (may be taken concurrently).\nOpen Economy Macroeconomics\nThe course provides an overview of models, methods, research, and current issues in Open Economy Macroeconomics. Today, an international perspective to study Macroeconomics is perhaps more important than ever before. Countries do not operate in isolation, but events in one country affect people around the world. Why do some countries grow faster than others? What are the effects of monetary and fiscal policy, domestically and abroad? Why do some countries run trade deficits and others trade surpluses? Does it matter? And why do some countries encounter financial crises and what can we do about them? In trying to answer these questions, the first part of the semester will be devoted to asset-based models of exchange rates and price level determination, and the second to open economy models of the short and medium run.\nPrerequisite: ECON 251 and\u00a0ECON 272 (may be taken concurrently).\nHealth Economics\nThis seminar provides an overview of health economics, covering the demographic and socio-economic determinants of health and the design and implementation of health care systems in both domestic and global contexts.\u00a0 Students will apply economic theory to model demand for health and health care, cost-effective intervention choices, the value of a statistical life, and optimal health insurance. Using this grounding, students will read state-of-the-art empirical research on recent policies such as the Oregon Medicaid Experiments, the Affordable Care Act, and pay-for-performance programs in developing countries.\nPrerequisite: ECON 250 and\u00a0ECON 272 (may be taken concurrently).",

This course provides a historical survey of the evolution of U.S. urban schooling, tracing its development from the earliest community-based, one-room schoolhouses, to modern major urban unified school districts. We explore the roles that industrialization and immigration have played in the urbanization of communities, and the ways in which schools have adapted in order to provide for the socialization of the urban worker. We examine shifts in the politics of public education as it pertains to control over schools and schooling and the various stakeholders involved.

We will study the films of Ernst Lubitsch, Billy Wilder, Fritz Lang, Robert Siodmak, Michael Curtiz, and Otto Preminger, paying particular attention to how they formulated key aspects of film noir and romantic comedy. While film noir paints a bleak picture of passion, violence, and desperation in American culture, the rom com structure promises pleasure and reconciliation, transgressive zaniness wedded to social order. But films in these two contrasting genres often tell different versions of the same story, or provide entangled perspectives on related American possibilities, and we will continually compare them in order to consider issues of cinematographic technique and style, plot and tone, agency and structure, capitalism and class, gender and sexuality, as well as race and power. Throughout the course, we\u2019ll learn to think about how these filmmakers experienced exile, and how that experience made its way into their films. In addition to coming away with a basic grasp of film history and analysis, as well as the importance of genre in the evolution of American cinema, students will also learn about the early history of Hollywood and the complex relationship between Jewishness, antifascism, and whiteness in the first half of\u00a0the 20th century.",

Our study of these literary works will enable us to understand key developments in the legal and religious thinking of Renaissance Europe (especially England), and the relevance of these innovations to the complex role revenge plays in our current moment. We will likewise survey some influential philosophers of revenge from antiquity to the present, and if time allows, we\u2019ll examine the importance of revenge to contemporary fiction and film.

Fewer realized that surrealist aesthetic techniques\u00a0were being practiced at the exact same time\u00a0within the Black Diaspora, among its Francophone, Anglophone, and Hispanophone speakers. Surrealism attracted artists, intellectuals, and activists from so many different cultures because it surpassed previous avant-garde art movements in linking creativity to a critique of colonialism. It is not surprising that surrealism found a special expression in the African Diaspora.\nHowever, the sheer breath of African Diaspora\u00a0artists taking up surrealist techniques and themes is staggering.

From Homer's The Odyssey and Grimm's fairytales, to Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and Salman Rushdie's Shame,\u00a0monsters challenge our everyday ideas about normality. Situated between the animal and the human, monstrous creatures are ciphers for difference that force us to consider what we regard as culturally abject or grotesque, as well as alluring. That these mythical figures continue to fascinate even as they frighten, is suggestive of their symbolic power in embodying both our latent desires and prohibitions. This course will explore the emergence of the monstrous aesthetic across several genres (epic, drama, novel, poetry, film) and periods (Renaissance to contemporary) to probe the shifting terrains of sexual, racial, and cultural otherness that monsters represent. Along the way, we will ask critical questions that arise from the study of monstrosity. What, for instance, separates monsters from humans? How does monstrosity define our notions about beauty and ugliness, desire and disgust? Does the monster appear each time under a different guise? If so, to what extent does it reshape our sensibility about what is socially abnormal? What can monsters teach us about the hopes and apprehensions of the cultures and times to which they belong?

    "description": "Before the modern novel, we had romance: the literature of error and erring, stories of characters who set out on a quest and lose their way due to madness, obsession, lack of faith, or the difficulty of knowing the truth about themselves or their quests. Romance was one of the most important genres of imaginative literature in medieval and Renaissance Europe, and yet it was also the one that provoked the most profound moral and aesthetic concern. Hugely popular, romance was often condemned for its endless attention to pleasure, pain, error, and forgetting, for its perverse magical stories of exploration and complicity, for its unseemly analysis of chivalric duty and obsession--and even for its capacity to corrupt its readers beyond repair. (Famously, Don Quixote was driven mad by reading romances!) Whether viewed as a genre of utopian dreaming or of lurid and dangerous narrative failure, romance is a vexed concept. By examining pre-modern and modern genre theory, this class will explore the formation of the category of romance across medieval and Renaissance England (with some attention paid to France, Italy, and Spain), thus giving students an opportunity to consider how genre can enable and constrain understanding of particular works of literature. Texts may include Virgil's Aeneid, Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes Arthurian tales, Geoffrey Chaucer's Troilus and Crisyede, the anonymous Pearl-Poet\u2019s Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Miguel de Cervantes's Don Quixote, Philip Sidney\u2019s Arcadia, Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queene, William Shakespeare\u2019s Cymbeline, and Mary Wroth\u2019s Urania.

Most people know the founders justified the American Revolution\u00a0 as a response to Britain's tyranny during the colonial period. Fewer know that \"tyranny\" became a watchword for national debates over race, gender, and class conflicts. What happens to the idea of \"tyranny\" when it refers to threats within a nation rather than outside forces? What happens when the calls for revolution that founded the nation are asserted once again, to save the nation from its worst self? The political and ethical political implications of this 18th and 19th century conflict reverberate today. Only a multi-genre approach, incorporating a wide range of authors, could do justice to these questions. For these reasons, we will examine revolutionary pamphlets, speeches, essays, freed-persons narratives, and poetry from authors as diverse as Joseph Warren, Phillis Wheatley, Phillip Freneau, Harriet Jacobs, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Walt Whitman, and Emily Dickinson. Finally, this course listens to voices too often obscured by our focus on well-known characters in American history: the unofficial soldiers of the American Revolution, the freed-persons who emancipated themselves from slavery, the conflicted Civil War Veterans, and the working-class Americans trying to find their place in Reconstruction-era America.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Major Requirement Met: Group II",

Along the way, students will address several questions: How does literature represent demands for social change that transgress the law, like the freed persons escaping slavery? How to distinguish fugitives fighting for freedom from unprincipled outlaws? Is emancipation a single act, legal declaration or a more complicated process? And for whom? Finally, how do we grapple with the backlash to political change? By focusing on the 19th century, we can rethink how African Americans found political agency generations before the most familiar events from the Civil Rights era. Most of all, this course allows students to read literature alongside historical documents, so they can see firsthand how debates over freedom evolved in the 19th\u00a0century.\u00a0\nMajor Requirement Met: Group II",

The 1930s is such an intriguing decade because the global economic collapse spawned new, or renewed older, political and artistic movements. In the global 1930's, people considered art central to rethinking political allegiances and the overarching meaning of politics itself. The 1930s helps to clarify the following question in our present-day: what cultural rebuilding remains to be done and how does art contribute to such processes? Writers of the 1930's took up this question in several different forms: through the trope of the document and its archival drive, the unconscious and the search for the Marvelous, the raised fist of labor movements or anti\u00adracist activism. This course will look at several literary (and related art) movements in, and cutting across, America, the Caribbean, and Europe. Texts will include (but are not limited to) documentary writing from Muriel Rukeyser, Richard Wright, and Langston Hughes; Surrealist writing from Europe and the Caribbean, including Aime Cesaire and Georges Bataille; and other forms of art like the photography of Cathy Cahun.\nMajor Requirement Met: Group III",

If part of the aim of the colonial apparatus was to collect knowledge of the world in ways that bodies, cultures, and landscapes could be understood and ordered by the West, contemporary societies are now negotiating their own means of self-representation in the often-violent space of postcolonial rupture.\u00a0 Throughout the term, we will work with texts and visual images produced out of, and in response to, the history of the colonial encounter.\u00a0 Drawing on a broad range of literary, filmic, and theoretical materials we will develop strategies for understanding the production and consumption of postcolonial representation, in both local and global contexts.\u00a0 As consumers of these cultural products within the space of the Western academy, we will be attentive to the function of the stereotype as we consider representations of gender and sexuality, violence and terrorism, class structures, and migration.\nMajor Requirement Met: Group III",

This first absence does not seem to have been filled in the many centuries that have followed. Both in number and quality, modern treatments of laughter seem inadequate. This weakness is perhaps because the funny is constitutively unavailable to rational representation. This class will explore laughter as exactly the embodied symptom that arises out of the intrinsic inadequacies of representation. After a quick critique of traditional theories of mimesis, we will explore the generation of laughter through various contemporary theories and attempt to understand its function for the liberation of the unrepresented in works thought funny, from Laurence Sterne to Ishmael Reed.

    "description": "Climate change in the past pushed societies and empires to expand, contract, and clash with their neighbors. The Roman Empire flourished during its Climatic Optimum, a period of warm, stable weather patterns that supported agriculture and the annexation of Egypt. Yet, later periods of climate change pushed nomadic states to invade Rome\u2019s borders, and a Late Antique Little Ice Age further stressed the empire. Across the Atlantic Ocean, the Maya flourished under positive climatic conditions and then slowly retreated due to anthropogenic drought. Into the medieval and early modern periods, the effects of the Little Ice Age between 1300 and 1850 can be seen in the near-constant string of wars, slavery, and famine that shaped North America. Can looking at episodes of climate change in the past inform how we think about climate change and the Anthropocene\u2013our present period of human-caused climate change\u2013now? This is an interdisciplinary seminar that will combine methods and readings from historical climatology, paleoclimatology, anthropology, and environmental science.

This semester we will seek to understand this concept of disenchantment, from the way it structures our view of the world, to the way different schools of thought have answered it. To do so, we will read some of the seminal writings on the theory, as well as look at the spectrum of literary responses it has generated, with particular attention to the various efforts to infuse or rediscover in the world the sort of awe, surprise, and wonder that such a rational approach would appear to blot out. Our reading will move through diverse genres, such as romanticism, gothic, mystery, mythology, and science fiction, in the work of authors from William Wordsworth and Mary Shelley to Jorge Luis Borges and Derek Walcott.",

This lens focuses on what texts do, placing the authors of such text as having agency and driven by the social relationship within their community. To do this, students will learn methods to analyze not only print texts, but also texts that are multimodal.

    "description": "One of the unique characteristics of modernity is the belief that the meaning of our lives is not given to us, pre-determined by race, class, gender or familial inheritance, but something that each individual must determine for themselves. To be a self in modernity, in other words, is to be a living project, a project in which we each determine the meaning of our lives by virtue of the paths we take, the passions we pursue, and the actions we choose. This idea, however, is neither acultural nor atemporal, but largely the historical inheritance of the ground breaking philosophical, literary, and artistic movement that occurred in Germany around 1800 known as German Romanticism. Within European history, it was this Romantic movement which first developed the idea that became so central to modernity that each human being is thrown out onto a path, on a search for meaning in a world in which no absolute meaning can be given. This course will investigate this problem by engaging with some of the central works of German Romanticism as well as the artistic and intellectual movements that it inspired such as American Transcendentalism and Existentialism. We will investigate these themes in an interdisciplinary way by reading works of literature, philosophy, and music as well as looking at works of art and film both historical and contemporary.  \nReading may include: Novalis, Beethoven, Nietzsche, Van Gogh, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Hermann Hesse, Carl Gustav Jung, Albert Camus, Sartre, J.D.

    "description": "Asian immigration in the U.S. holds a specific history in relation to other migrant or racialized groups. Stock narratives of Asian identity are often constructed under the model minority myth and U.S. exceptionalism, relegating Asians as forever foreigners in the U.S. imaginary. In response to these constricting narratives, Asian/Americans have historically pushed back through writing and various modes of cultural production. However, the Covid-19 pandemic has escalated anti-Asian violence and hate speech, making more visible this violence that Asian/Americans have experienced and the campaigns and activism they have mobilized. In this FYS, students will explore the cultural production of texts from the Asian diaspora that have responded to social injustices. We will analyze writing as a practice that is socially constructed by people across time and space and within specific cultural contexts, a theoretical lens situated in the field of Composition and Rhetoric and Writing Studies, and more specifically Cultural Rhetoric. This lens focuses on what texts do, placing the authors of such text as having agency and driven by the social relationships within their community. To do this, students will learn methods to analyze not only print texts, but also texts that are multimodal. For example, students will read and analyze genres such as the graphic novel, short story, film, and other counterstories written from the Asian diaspora in response to social injustices. Throughout the first half of the semester, you will write two papers based on the assigned readings, while searching for a locally based research topic for your final paper; you will need to identify your research topic roughly halfway through the course. By the end of the semester, students will have gained a stronger understanding of the research and writing process. Open only to first year frosh.",

Researchers are now beginning to understand how social class shaped the soundscape of modernity, how race influenced ideals of odorlessness and \u201codorous\u201d others, and how experiences of and ideas about touch and taste become gendered. Embodied and sensorial studies offer a new view into the social construction of the sensorium. Yet, sensory studies largely remains marginal within the wider disciplinary field of history. Such is the status of the history of emotions, or \u201csoft history\u201d, as well, a field of study mostly disparaged in contemporary scholarship. But anger, love, fear, disgust, and joy are historical and social artifacts! So this course will invite us to think, sense, and feel about the past and the present through the methods of sensory studies and history of emotions, and participants will write and research about particular senses or emotions in a historical-cultural lens through the seminar.",

This course takes an interdisciplinary approach to exploring monstrosity and the socio-historical conditions that produce particular kinds of fictional \u201cmonsters.\u201d Special attention will be paid to the ways in which monsters disrupt hegemonic constructions of the \u201cnormal\u201d and challenge notions of inclusion/exclusion. We\u2019ll look at the evolving character of demons, vampires, zombies, and other things that go bump in the night through the lenses of literature and film. By the end of the course, students will develop their own definitions and theories of monsters in relation to contemporary culture. The Monster Theory Reader (Weinstock) is the core, critical text. Literary texts will likely include (all or in part) Dracula (Stoker), Fledgling (Butler), and a bevy of unnerving short stories.

Although ecocriticism has historically overlooked multiethnic US literature and culture, artists, filmmakers, and writers from diverse backgrounds have been preoccupied with the contested terrain of the US built environment since the inception of the nation.  More recently, these visionaries have moved beyond the preservationist framework of mainstream environmentalism to voice concerns about environmental issues ranging from climate change and species loss to factory farming and genetic modification.  In negotiating these entanglements, we will address the following questions: if everyday experiences of life are intensely environmental, why, then, have certain experiences been privileged in writings about the environment?  And, what environmental stories emerge from your encounters with the world as a student at Oxy as well as a resident of Los Angeles?",

In myth he was attended by raving Maenads and mischievous Satyrs; amongst humans he was worshiped with festive dances, communal shouts, ritual obscenities, and (perhaps most importantly) with poetry\u2014with the literary genres of ode, comedy and tragedy that were invented specifically to honor him. What could be farther, we might ask, from the cool, reasonable practice of philosophy than this wild, uncanny, irrational god? And yet, as we shall see in this class, this reckless god of madness and poetry stands at the foundation of some of the most important ideas in modern philosophy\u2014Hegel's phenomenology of spirit, Nietzsche's will to power, Heidegger's philosophy of Existenz, Bataille's notion of excess, and Derrida's \"non-concept\" of differance.

Emphasis is on factors governing the physical properties, nutrient availability, and plant growth and production within soils. How to classify soils and to assess nutrient cycling and contaminant fate will be covered. Recommended: introductory geology, chemistry and/or biology.\nPaleontology: The Record of Life, Landscapes, and Changing Climate\nThis course will use the fossil record as a tool to explore the geologic controls on the evolution and extinction of life on earth. From Snowball Earth to the Great American Biotic Interchange, plate tectonics and climate change drive the distribution of life through time. We will examine paleontological and modern ecosystems through classes, labs, and field trips.\u00a0 Students should have completed GEO105 and at least one 200-level course in biology or geology.\nGeochemistry\nThis course will explore the geochemical principles controlling fundamental geologic systems, from the \"weathering engine,\" to the igneous-metamorphic-hydrothermal systems that form and shape planets. This overview of Geochemistry will focus on thermodynamics and kinetics, which allow us to assess these systems with regards to temperature, pressure, and time. Quantitative evaluation of earth processes through geochemical modeling will be conducted using the programs SUPCRT, Visual Minteq, and Geochemist's Workbench (industry standards).

    "description": "A basic understanding of Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud is a prerequisite for participating in critical debates in the humanities and social sciences. In this course we will read some of the central texts in which these thinkers developed their revolutionary models of analysis: historical materialism, post-metaphysical philosophy, and psychoanalysis. Though different, what all three of these thinkers had in common was a rejection of the rational subject and with it the notion that commonplace social norms involved in knowledge, morality, and sexuality represented timeless and universal truths determined by a neutral subjectivity. Instead, each sought to explain how these norms were in fact social constructions that are best explained by analyzing the specific historical and sociological conditions in which they arose. For Marx, this project involved an analysis of how power and class relations contribute to the production of \u201cideology\u201d, for Nietzsche an investigation into the history and transformation of morality, and Freud the exploration of the unconscious. The result is a radical transformation of our understanding of subjectivity and a realization of the deeply contingent and malleable nature of human existence. We will investigate these theories by examining works of Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud within their contemporaneous contexts, drawing on the literature, art, and music of the time as well as more recent history and film as points of elucidation and comparison. This course will meet three times a week. Twice with CSLC 107 with discussion conducted in English, and a third weekly meeting in which all readings and discussions will be conducted in German.",

    "description": "The obsession with interpreting moral character based on physical (especially facial) features has endured since antiquity under the name of \"physiognomy.\" Strangely, interest in this esoteric art exploded during the \"Age of Reason,\" the Enlightenment, when it first became codified as an empirical science. Starting with the writings of Johann Caspar Lavater, whose monumental \"Physiognomic Fragments\" (1775-1778) advocated physiognomy as a means of \"promoting human understanding and human love,\" this course will explore the widespread influence that the art of interpreting physical features had in the intellectual and artistic milieu of the 18th century, and, arguably, continues to exert in the modern day. We will examine physiognomy in the aesthetic, cultural, literary, and scientific contexts of the German Enlightenment, dealing with such major figures as Goethe, Lessing, Lichtenberg, Schiller, and Hegel, as well as its unprecedented boom in popularity around 1900, when it was embraced by many prominent strands of German thought, from the \"philosophy of life\" (Nietzsche, Spengler, Kassner) and literary modernism (Rilke, Benn, Musil), to eugenics, criminology, and racial biology. In concluding with the rise of Nazism and their attacks on modern art as \"degenerate,\" the course will assess to what extent Walter Benjamin's thesis that \"[t]here is no document of civilization which is not at the same time a document of barbarism\" holds true for the historical trajectory of German thought. Topics include: the relationship between texts and images, theories and practices of interpretation, as well as the complicity of the arts and sciences in constructing theories of racial difference.

    "description": "What is despair and what does it tell us about being human that we alone can seemingly experience it? Is it equivalent to sadness or depression? Can it be relieved by material wealth, fame, success? For Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard despair was not a passing temporal condition but something that in itself points beyond itself to the possibility of its own overcoming. In doing so, despair, for Kierkegaard, forces open the crucial existential question: What does it mean to be a self? This course will examine this question by exploring changing conceptions of selfhood and despair from antiquity to modernity, moving from Achilleus\u2019 despairing rage in the Iliad to Dostoyevsky\u2019s depiction of the individual revolting against society in the Notes From the Underground and culminating in the seemingly irredeemable despair of Cormack McCarthy. Readings will include works by Homer, Plato, Thucydides, the Stoics, Marguerite of Porete, Meister Eckhart, Martin Luther, Soren Kierkegaard, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Leo Tolstoy, Franz Kafka, Cormack McCarthy, and Flannery O\u2019Connor.

    "description": "This course will investigate the concept of madness as both a social category and\u00a0one of the crucial terms of art and literature.\u00a0 On the one hand, madness often carries with it a negative connotation, as a statement or mental state beyond the realm of sense. Yet on the other, aesthetic theory has long considered madness\u00a0a necessary condition of great art. For the philosopher Immanuel Kant, the art of the genius must break the rules of style and\u00a0explode the bounds of the ordinary sense in order to be exceptional. Art, in this sense must necessarily push the boundaries of the normal, straddle the realms of\u00a0madness and sanity and, in doing so, transform the categories we use to understand the world. Thus by seeing madness not as some eternal category, but as constructed and deconstructed in concrete contexts,\u00a0the dialectic of madness and genius forces upon us\u00a0the following questions: How does the concept of madness get constructed? Who gets to decide who is and isn't mad and why? Why is the creation of art so tightly bound up with concept of madness? What does this tell us about how we make sense of the world and the possibilities of changing our own forms of understanding? We will investigate these questions by reading works of literature and philosophy that directly and indirectly address issues of madness and its relationship to creativity. \u00a0Readings\u00a0will include works by Michel Foucault, Franz Kafka, Heinrich von Kleist, Honore de Balzac, Virginia Woolf,\u00a0Deleuze & Guattari, Goethe,\u00a0Adalbert Stifter, Immanuel Kant,\u00a0and Ralf Waldo Emerson.\nThis section will meet once a week extra to discuss these texts as read in the original German.

    "description": "This course will be centered around an in-depth investigation of one of the most controversial and influential philosophers of the 20th Century, Martin Heidegger. Rejecting what he saw as the tradition of western metaphysics and its quest for absolute knowledge, Heidegger's phenomenological\u00a0approach focused on an analysis of lived experience\u00a0and the structures that make that experience possible. Fundamental to this analysis are the ideas of finitude and fallibility. Human beings, for Heidegger, are never closed and completed, secure in their knowledge and understanding of themselves, but beings who are fundamentally concerned with their own being, who seek to determine themselves from within the complex social, historical, and interpersonal contexts into which they were thrown. As such, philosophy, for Heidegger, becomes interpretation, the attempt to interpret and reinterpret oneself and one's place within a changing and complex world, always with the possibility of failure. The course will investigate this project of \"existential hermeneutics\" through an in-depth investigation of some of Heidegger's major writings. The first half of the course will focus on a close reading of the first half of\u00a0Being and Time\u00a0while in the second half we will look at Heidegger's post war essays, his turn to \"poetic thinking\" and the legacy of Heidegger's thought on 20th century Continental philosophy. We will investigate Heidegger's works from out of their historical context, including Heidegger's relation to National Socialism.\nIn addition to the English section, this course will meet for an additional session per week to read the texts in their original German and discuss the nuance and difference in meaning as it is transmitted through the original language. Reading the text in the original German is particularly important in the case of Heidegger, whose philosophical program cannot be separated from his thinking about language and the intricate relationship between language and meaning.\u00a0\nA completed final paper for this course with a\u00a0mark of C or higher can also serve to fulfill the Second-Stage Writing Requirement.",

    "description": "Derided or revered, there is no question that the Enlightenment is important. But what was the Enlightenment?\u00a0This course will investigate the Enlightenment in all its complexities and contradictions. As an era defined by radical critique, Enlightenment thinkers rejected the authority of religion, tradition, and aristocracy, and sought to transform our understanding of nature, culture, and history by grounding these fields\u00a0on the transparent rational principles of freedom, progress, and universality. In doing this, the Enlightenment embroiled itself and us in a contradiction. It\u00a0both created the fundamental terms, ideals, and institutions\u00a0that frame our contemporary understanding of the world\u00a0while also establishing a discourse of universality and eurocentrism that serves as the object of our greatest critique. Yet far from being one thing, the Enlightenment also possessed the tools for its own self critique. Or, in the words of Johann Gottfried Herder, \"What is universal reason but a cover for our favorite, whims, idolatry, blindness and laziness.?\" Following, Herder, Rousseau, and Goethe, this course will also investigate the alternative conceptions of nature, culture, and history that rejected the universalist and imperialist strand of Enlightenment thinking in favor of a dynamic, process-oriented understanding of history and nature as\u00a0eternally unfolding. With this conception, the Enlightenment perhaps offers\u00a0an alternative to help us in our quest to think beyond it. Readings and persons of engagement may include, Descartes, Locke, Leibniz, Rousseau, Herder, Kant, Goethe,\u00a0Lessing, Defoe, Alexander von Humboldt, Haydn, Mozart, and Schiller.\u00a0\u00a0\nNo prior knowledge of the texts or the period will be assumed in instruction. By the end of the course, students will have a solid understanding of the historical, cultural, and intellectual context of the period we call The Enlightenment as well as the fundamental problems and questions that were addressed at that time. Students will also have a solid understanding of the divergent ways in which these questions were answered and the different conceptions of culture, history, and literature that arose out from these answers. Additionally, students will develop an understanding of the various legacies of the Enlightenment and have an opportunity to grapple with the positive and negative aspects of that legacy in the contemporary cultural context.\u00a0\nThe course will consist of two parts. First, the Tuesday-Thursday lecture in English (shared with CSLC 118) and second, a German language section in which we read the texts in which we read the texts in the original and discuss the nuances of the text as it reads in the original language.

This course will explore the shifting conceptions of metamorphosis - the transformation of \"forms [...] into \"new bodies,\" and vice versa - from its mythic origins in Ovid, to its modern manifestations and modulations in the works of Goethe, Darwin, and Kafka. Throughout the course, we will examine the ambiguous relationship between \"forms\" and \"bodies\" in Western thought, and how the permutations of this nexus come to bear on a wide variety of different topics in the Humanities, including: myths and theories of changing forms in nature (plants, clouds, animals); dynamic representations of gender, sexuality, and erotics; as well as figures of hybridity and the grotesque (human-animal hybrids, beasts, and monstrosities).

    "description": "After the end of WWII, the generation of what would become known as the 68ers found themselves in a precarious position. They came into adulthood to realize that their parent\u2019s generation were if not perpetrators then\u00a0at least accomplices to one of the gravest genocides in human history, that they had enthusiastically endorsed a fascistic manic, that the\u00a0country they inhabited\u00a0stood in ruins, bombed to the ground morally and physically, and that they now stood at the epicenter\u00a0of the cold war, half capitalist, half communist. From the perspective of the 68ers, the worst of all was that there had been no cultural\u00a0reckoning. With the conclusion of the Nuremberg trials and the prosecution of the elite Nazi administration, the majority of the population seemed content to simply to forget. For the 68ers that was not an option. Rather than view the WWII and the Holocaust as an aberration and horrific exception to German culture, the youth of the 68er generation demanded a revolutionary reevaluation of everything German. They asked: What factors, economic, social, cultural, and historical, led to this catastrophe? How can we come to terms with this past? And what vision of a transformed future could replace the old? The answer to these questions involved a three-step approach. A radical critique of the past and the structures of nationalism, patriarchy, heteronormativity, racism, and capitalism, which they believed were the foundational underpinnings of German fascism. Active political dissent that demanded change and culminated in the domestic bombings of the left-wing group the Red Army Faction. And a total re-conception of the norms of society, sexuality, and selfhood perhaps best represented in the Love Parade and the drugs, sex, and radical experimentation that fueled the raves and Berlin techno scene after the fall of the Berlin Wall.\nThis course will investigate the transformations of postwar German society in the literature, philosophy, film, photography, and art of the time. We will focus on the social critiques of the Frankfurt School of Critical Theory, political resistance in both the communist East and capitalist West Germany as well as the life in and relationship between the two, and the utopic visions of the postwar German left\u00a0as well as the success and failures of this radical political movement. Readings and figures may include: Adorno, Horkheimer, Marcuse, Deleuze, Foucault, Crista Wolf, Max Frisch, The Baader-Meinhof Complex, Rainald Goetz, Anselm Kiefer, Helene\u00a0Hegemann, and Felix Denk.\nThe German section of the course will meet three\u00a0times weekly. It will meet twice together with CSLC 122. For these meetings readings and discussion will be in English. Additionally, GERM 322 will meet once a week to read and discuss selected text in the original German. Reading knowledge of German is a prerequisite for enrolling in GERM 322.\u00a0Students completing the final paper in this course with a grade of C or higher can use this work to satisfy the Second-Stage Writing Requirement.",

But one form of literature, at least, has always known otherwise. For no matter what philosophy, religion, ethics, or the law try to tell us, comedy will never let us forget that we exist, in this world at least, in and through our bodies. The bodies of comedy, however, unlike the bodies of science, art, or athletics, are neither orderly, nor inspiring, nor ideal. The comedic body is unruly, excessive, needy, offensive\u2014in a word, impolite. What is special about comedy, however, as this class will endeavor to show, is that it encourages us not to despair over our shared condition of gross embodiment, but rather to unite ourselves around it. Comedy creates community from the shared experience of our bodies\u2014 from our corpulent, crapulent, concupiscent corporeality. Having no interest in the maintenance of an ideal \"body politic,\" comedy rejoices in the humble togetherness of a \"body impolitic.\" Though this course will aim to establish a history of comedy from the ancient Greeks and Romans to the Medieval, Renaissance, and Restoration eras (and beyond), it will also make constant reference to modern comedic phenomena; the sit-com, the rom-com, the stand-up, the parody, and the roast\u2014to name but a few. In addition to attending the 3 hours of lecture required of students in CSLC 285, students in Greek 385 are required to attend an additional 90 minutes of class per week to read and discuss texts in the original language.\u00a0Students in this course are required to complete a 10-12-page interpretive paper, one that incorporates the students' own translations of original texts.

Traditionally, of course, the myth of Ulysses has been understood as a rather sentimental myth of nostos, or \"homecoming\": the hero, forced by fate into hateful foreign places, finally wins his way back to the security, stability, and contented self-\u00adsufficiency of his own native land. Or so the story goes. In this course, however, we will test the thesis that something more like the opposite of this interpretation may hold true. It may be, in other words, that the wanderings of the Ulysses figure (whether through the seas of the Mediterranean, the streets of Dublin, or the isles of the West Indies) work not so much to affirm the self\u00ad-sufficiency and comfort of home, as to trouble and destabilize it. What the heroes of these works might finally come to understand - and may even rejoice in - is not the idea that there is \"no place like home,\" but rather that, in the end, it is only within a certain placelessness that we are ever really \"at home,\" at all.

And yet, as this course shall argue, the work itself\u2014and in some ways, the entirety of Plato\u2019s literary and philosophic oeuvre\u2014might be understood as structured around a single question: namely, how are we to connect the experience of human desire with the necessity of human community? We shall be devoting one week to each chapter of this great work, and two weeks apiece to Chapters Five, Six and Seven. Beyond the reading of individual chapters, students will be asked to provide, week by week, a detailed commentary on selected passages in the original Greek, and summations of assigned secondary literature.

By the 4th century BCE, Plato seems to have concluded that philosophy must eschew any interest in the flesh, inasmuch as flesh (whatever it may be) cannot yield to precise, philosophical investigation. Perhaps even more crucially, Plato stipulated that flesh cannot and should not be the basis of a politics, as it is only philosophical insight, in its disciplined refusal of the lure of the flesh, that could serve as the ground of genuine political communion. From here it was but a short step to conclude that poetry (and of course, \"art in general\"), entangled as it was with the body, could have little meaning or import for the practice of either politics or philosophy.\nInfluential as these weighty pronouncements surely have been on the history and development of Western thought, resistance to them, it should be noted, was almost immediate--beginning perhaps with the work of Plato himself! In this course, we shall examine the ways in which literature and art, as a \"poetics of the flesh,\" offers us a practice as rigorous, and productive, as any purported philosophy of abstract, spiritual forms. We shall then consider what such a poetics of the flesh might be able to offer philosophy itself as an intellectual discipline. Finally, we shall engage with recent theories concerning the way in which authentic political community might rest not on the eschewal of the flesh, but its deliberate and thoughtful \"incorporation\" (pun intended).\nThe first half of the class will focus on older material (certain Ancient Greek and Roman poets, Plato, Aristotle, the New Testament, as well as some medieval writers and thinkers); the second half of the class, however, will turn to the work of more recent poets and theorists of the flesh, with a particular emphasis on the investigations of Jean-Luc Nancy into the significance of the arts, and what he calls the \"sense of sense.\"\u00a0\nThis course will share lecture time with CSLC 288, but will meet for an additional 90 minutes per week to translate and read selections from Plato's Republic and Ion, Aristotle's Poetics, Physics, and Rhetoric,\u00a0and the New Testament, in the original Greek.\u00a0Students completing the final paper in this course with a grade of C or higher can use this work to satisfy the Second Stage Writing requirement.",

Each case study offers a unique perspective on the question of how broad economic structures of colonization, slavery, and the market revolution shaped human encounters between natives and newcomers, captives and captors, slaves and slaveholders, Northerners and Southerners. Ultimately, these case studies encourage a critical rethinking of concepts of liberty, equality, and democracy, which have formed the bedrock of master narratives in United States history. Within the context of these broad, sweeping themes, we will look closely at primary historical documents, produced by men and women of their time period, and we will carefully read the arguments of historians in our own time.

A sampling of our topics: 19th-century Palestine, the emergence of nationalism as a historical phenomenon, early Zionist settlement in Palestine and Palestinian society at the beginning of the twentieth Century, Zionist women activists and Palestinian women, World War I and British rule, the 1936-39 Palestinian Revolt, the 1948 War for Palestine and its aftermath, Israeli-Arab relations in the 1950s, the Suez War, the implications of gendering the nation, the 1967 War and the subsequent occupation of the West Bank, Gaza and the Golan Heights, the demographic \"race,\" Israel in Lebanon, the Intifadas, and the peace processes.\nSurvey Requirement Met:\u00a0Middle East and Africa",

    "description": "According to Thomas Jefferson, America was to be an \"agrarian Republic\" - a pastoral farmland, a different world from the dirty and decaying cities of monarchical Europe. Yet, by Jefferson's day, it was already too late. North America had been dotted with great metropolises and minor towns for thousands of years, and new waves of European and African settlers founded hundreds of new ones, as well. Indeed, for many early migrants, America was itself a \"city on the hill\" - an urban image for a new society. In this course, we will survey American urban history from those early days to the present, focusing, in the second half, specifically on Los Angeles, where new forms of decentralized urbanism took form in the 20th century. We will not only explore suburbia and freeways, Disneyland, and other quasi\u00adurban outposts, but also the changing character of the inner city in the mid-20th century, as well as radical efforts to reform existing American cities. In the process, we encounter the American city of today - multicentered, privately planned, decentralized, and multiethnic. We will conclude by asking whether contemporary developments in urbanism - the changing character of public space, the turn to privatism, the neglect of public transport infrastructures, and challenges to democracy and equality - are ultimately compatible with the American dream of the \"city on the hill\" for the 21st century.",

Multi-lingual, multi-ethnic and multi-religious Ottoman society and culture were comprised of Muslim, Byzantine Christian, Turkish, Greek, Persian, Mongol, Slavic, Armenian, Arab, African and Jewish cultural elements. Edicts from the Ottoman state were regularly issued in nine languages. One reason for its longevity was its willingness to draw on the diversity of this rich historical and cultural tableau.

Students will conduct original research into African American activism that stretched from New York to California before and after the U.S. Civil War. We will explore the social networks and political institutions that 19th-century African Americans built to fight for civil rights, economic justice, and an end to chattel slavery. At the heart of the course is a digital humanities component that will involve students in researching the lives and ideas of individual Black activists. At the end of the course, we will contribute our collective research to the national website, Colored Conventions. While engaged in original historical research, students will also be reading exciting scholarship on the rise of free Black communities in the U.S. and the emergence of African American institutions (churches, schools, press, political organizations). We will delve into questions such as: how did free African Americans, from leadership to grassroots levels, organize for racial equality, abolition, and community empowerment? How did class structures and gender ideology shape the dynamics of Black organizing? What transnational relationships and diasporic identities did Black activists build in the protracted struggles for abolition and citizenship?",

Culture was central to this transformative moment, contributing to a \"counter-culture\" that made distinct claims on our politics and even our most private modes of social interaction. If the \"personal is political\"--as the 60s mantra would have it--then something as seemingly ephemeral as \"style\" becomes a mode of resistance. Style as resistance was expressed in everything from slang of the time (summed up in the ubiquitous epithet of \"cool\"), to the theater of protest (and its ubiquitous musical soundtrack), even to something as seemingly ephemeral as dress and hair. In the process, the counter-culture of the 60s sought to rethink the nature of desire, the boundaries between public and private, the \"multiversity\" and the objectives of higher education,\u00a0the participation of women and \"minorities\" in society--and most especially, what it meant to be young. The focus of the course will be on the 1960s, but we will explore the ways in which culture, politics and history interact.\u00a0In particular we will examine the nature of cultural politics--its confusions and limitations as well as its liberatory potential--as an arena to address the era's most pressing social\u00a0concerns. Readings will include the seminal texts of the 1960s: \"The Port Huron\u00a0Statement, \"The Feminine Mystique,\u00a0The Autobiography\u00a0of Malcolm X;\u00a0along the cultural implications of some of its notable events such as the March on Washington, Woodstock\u00a0and the violence at\u00a0Altamont.",

It has been variously conceived as \"empty,\" a \"frontier,\" a \"garden of the world,\" the divine realization of the nation's \"manifest destiny\" (emblazoned in Occidental's motto). That expansionist mythology not only ignored the environmental limits to what John Wesley Powell memorably described as an \"impoverished landscape,\" it ran roughshod over the claims of indigenous peoples who lived there.\u00a0This course will examine the various ways in which mapmakers, historians, writers and artists have tried to challenge that mythology by reimagining\u00a0a different account (and future) of the American West. We will begin with reports from those\u00a0on the scene like Hinmatoowyalahqit (Chief Joseph) and Powell, turn to the historiography of the region\u00a0(from Turner to Limerick); and examine the efforts of\u00a0photographers (Curtis, R.

In the period between World War I and World War II, new and alternative models for the relationship between state and society challenged the existing political and social order, as many Europeans abandoned democracy as the ideal political system. Many turned to nationalist authoritarianism as the answer to the political, economic, and social crises shaking Europe. Italy, under the National Fascist Party, and Germany, ruled by the National Socialists, were the nations in which this flight from democracy became a full-fledged descent into dictatorship and one-\u00adparty rule.

Taken together, students will discern how migration serves as a determinant of health, and also learn about migrant resilience despite structural violence. The themes of medical racism and scapegoating, contagion narratives, occupational health, health movements, cross-cultural health communication, and medical citizenship will anchor course units. With particular attention to the analytical categories of race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and class, the course posits that history can make a critical contribution to our understanding of health inequities and to the development of migrant health justice. Students will gain skills in archival research, oral history methodologies, and digital storytelling, and they will be given the opportunity to participate in community-based engagement.",

This course traces the history of medicine through these different times, cultures and regions: theory and practice; great doctors and healers, both male and female; and the effects of epidemics, such as the Black Death, on the course of Western civilization.

At times, working class women and women of color have also been demonized as carriers of contagion or even romanticized as repositories of traditional wisdom. Furthermore, women\u2019s roles in community health have been heavily shaped by gendered and racial constructions of the body, disease, and wellbeing.\u00a0 Thus, while the focus of the course is on the social history of women\u2019s health and healing, the theoretical framework of the course also aims to explore how ideologies of gender, race, class, and sexuality shape women\u2019s relationship to community health as both caregivers and health-seekers. The course is organized by a set of common themes that cut across time, space, and racial/ethnic boundaries in U.S. History.\u00a0 Themes include: spirituality and healing; work and health; sexuality and reproduction; activism for health justice.\u00a0 An important goal of this course is to make connections between historical studies of women and health and present-day community health activism. Much of the course and especially the community partnership component focuses on the leadership of women of color in shaping agendas for community well-being.\u00a0 In the past, course participants have worked with the organizations Black Women for Wellness, California Latinas for Reproductive Justice, Visi\u00f3n y Compromiso, and Promesa Boyle Heights. We will continue to work this year with women\u2019s health organizations and the Southern California Library on a Reproductive Justice community partnership.

Nevertheless, Muslims often describe themselves as constituting a single community with shared sets of concerns. This class engages these differing views through an examination of the lives of Muslims over the past two centuries of globalization, colonialism, post-colonialism, nationalism, and ever-changing technologies of transportation and communication. Our inquiry will concentrate on how Muslims were caught up in, and reacted to, and, in turn, influenced the Great Transformation that reshaped the entire world over the past two centuries.

We will investigate the ways that rural populations were incorporated into, or excluded from, the processes of state-formation. Finally, we will look at how representations of peasant/tribe, in ideologies of state-building and nationalism, shaped social and political relations within some of the region's nation-states.

The course surveys the revolutions in 1917, the ruthless power struggles of the 1920s, the triumph of Stalin, the costly industrialization and collectivization drives, the \u201cGreat Terror,\u201d and the battle against fascism in World War II.\u00a0 It then examines the Cold War, the Soviet Union\u2019s efforts to reform itself, the economic chaos of the 1990s, and resurgent nationalism and authoritarianism in the information age.

Students will explore methodological approaches to historical inquiry, conduct research projects, and improve their writing skills. Open to majors and minors only or by permission of instructor.\u00a0Topics include:\nChristianity and Politics in America since 1945\nEvangelical voters and white Christian nationalism have become hot topics, but religion has long played an important role in the U.S. political arena. This junior historiography seminar will survey how historians have written about the relationship between Christianity and politics in America since the end of World War II. We will explore the role of the Protestant church in public life, Billy Graham's rise to fame, and the work of Christians and other religious leaders in shaping U.S. Cold War policy and engagement with the world.\u00a0We will also give attention to different\u00a0histories of the Religious or Christian Right and its 1970s marriage with the Republican Party, which has become one of the most successful political partnerships in American history.\u00a0Finally, we will consider histories\u00a0charting\u00a0Christians' role in national debates over civil rights, immigration and refugee policy, LGBTQ+ movements, and environmental justice.\u00a0\nNative American and Indigenous Histories\nThis historiography seminar examines the sources, methodologies, and theoretical approaches that scholars use to write Native American and Indigenous histories. The course highlights the field of ethnohistory, the interdisciplinary study of indigenous societies and cultures that draws from history, anthropology, archaeology, linguistics, and art history. The readings address the histories of First Nations peoples of North America, Central America, and South America, and explore a variety of topics, including native governance, sovereignty and resistance, lands and removals, wars, indigenous slavery, relations with the environment, gender and sexuality, and reproductive rights. The course is organized to illustrate major trends in ethnohistorical scholarship, and highlight shifts in themes, methods, and narrative frameworks over the last five decades.\nMexico-U.S. Borderlands\nStudies of the Mexico-U.S. Borderlands have been at the forefront in the development of transnational history frameworks as well as comparative discussions about borderlands histories. This seminar engages the fields of Native American Studies, Chicanx Studies, Mexican history, and U.S. Western history to trace the historiography of a region that has undergone a series of extensive transformations in the last three hundred years. In the modern era, it changed from a periphery of the Spanish empire, to provinces of northern Mexico, and finally, to the southwestern region of the United States. The area is a site of complicated and overlapping histories marked by processes of colonialism, diaspora, nationalism, and deterritorialization. With particular attention to issues of race, gender, place and power, prominent historiographical themes for the course include: the frontier thesis; war and displacement; transborder and transcultural communities; labor and transnational capitalism; extractivism and environmental justice; and migration and militarization. Cross-Listed as: LLAS 304.\nThe Fascist Revolution: Politics Culture and Society\nThis seminar closely studies the period known as Fascist Italy (1922 to 1945). Through a close analysis of the politics, culture, and society of Italy under Fascist dictatorship, we study the causes, character, and ramification of the Italian abandonment of democracy in the wake of World War I. Because it is a historiographic seminar, we examine the central debates of the field, such as whether Mussolini ruled primarily through coercion or consent, the extent of Fascist race ideology, and whether the regime was \"modern\" or \"backward-looking.\" Other major themes include: Fascist cultural modernism, gender and Fascism, and the Italian road to empire and World War II. This course uses primary sources such as translated documents, memoirs, and diaries, as well as contemporary historical analyses. \u00a0\nGender and Sexuality in Colonial Latin America\nThis historiography seminar examines the sources, methodologies, and theoretical approaches that shape the history of women, gender, and sexuality in colonial and nineteenth-century Latin America. A variety of interdisciplinary approaches and concerns are considered from an historical perspective, especially in relation to the fields of Latin American History, Women's/Gender History, and Sexuality Studies. The readings represent ethnic, racial, and class-based distinctions among women in Latin America, and emphasize the importance of using diverse approaches in reconstructing gender history and culture, particularly for indigenous and African women. The course is organized to illustrate major trends in the historical scholarship on colonial Latin America, and highlight the shift over the last three decades from the study of women to gender and, most recently, sexuality and back to women again.\n\nHistoriography is the study of how historians write history and how the field has evolved over time. In this class our emphasis will be on how the historian came to his or her conclusions, not simply on the conclusions themselves. We will also consider each work in relation to other books in the field. Students will analyze both primary and secondary sources to understand how history is conceived and written. Cross-Listed as:\u00a0LLAS 301.\nHistories of the French and Haitian Revolutions\nMany histories have been, and continue to be, written about these revolutions and they differ from each other substantially. This course examines this scholarly literature, taking into account the choices historians make as they compose their narratives. We will examine the roles of race, class, and gender in these accounts, why different events and social groups are featured centrally in some but not others. And we will consider such controversial criteria as \"accuracy,\" \"truth,\" \"evidence,\" and even \"fact\" all of which are interpreted in numerous ways within the historian's craft.\u00a0\nHistories of U.S. Empire\nWas/Is the United States an empire, and if so, what kind of empire was/is it? This upper-level colloquium will familiarize history majors and other advanced students with scholarly debates over the history of U.S. imperialism and engagement\u00a0in the world. Course readings draw from the writings of U.S. historians from the early twentieth century through the present. Particular attention will be given to the impact of the Cold War and the influence of the \"cultural\" and \"transnational\" turns on how historians have approached empire.\nInterpreting Civil War, Emancipation, and Reconstruction\nThis junior colloquium will address major debates and approaches within the historiography of the United States Civil War, Emancipation, and Reconstruction. Students will explore how American racial politics and new scholarly approaches have shaped major debates over the causes and consequences of civil war and national reconstruction. The class will take both a chronological and topical approach to historiographic analysis. We will begin by reading work from the Dunning School and critical challenges to Dunning from historians on the Left, such as W. E. B. Du Bois in his 1935 study Black Reconstruction. To understand the impact of new methods and sources, we will examine the multi-decade collaboration of social historians called the Freedmen and Southern Society Project. In the second half of the course, we will explore more recent trends in scholarship, including economic history and cultural history, as well as gender and sexuality studies and critical race theory. Finally, the class will conclude by considering historical interpretations of Civil War and Reconstruction in U.S. popular culture, through film, fiction, and drama. Students will write their own historiographic analysis on a chosen topic within Civil War, Emancipation, and Reconstruction scholarship.\u00a0\nThe Mexican Revolution\nStudies of the Mexican Revolution have been at the forefront in the development of modern Latin American social, political, and cultural history. The studies have also contributed to comparative discussions in world history about the meanings of revolutionary experience in the twentieth century. However, historians and other social scientists have reached no consensus about the Mexican Revolution from its periodization to its actual existence. This seminar will examine the competing set of interpretations, alongside primary sources, to analyze the origins, course, and legacy of the Mexican Revolution. Prominent historiographical themes for the course include: conflict between elite liberalism and mass mobilization; agrarian reform and unionization within a capitalist project of development; corporate representation of social interests; the institutionalization of revolution; race, gender, and class in nationalist rhetoric; and the role of art, education, and science/technology in state formation. Cross-Listed as:\u00a0LLAS 302.\nRe-Assessing European Global Encounters \nThe twentieth century national movements of liberation, from modern European colonialism, initiated new histories of the previous early modern age of exploration (1300-1800), from the point of view of the enslaved, the conquered, the exploited, and the newly liberated. Each student will be writing a historiographical essay revealing changing interpretations of one distinctive global encounter. Historians are re-assessing, on the Mediterranean, both the Crusades and piracy and kidnapping. Scholars specializing in trade or colonialism of a particular nation-state, such as Portugal, Spain, Netherlands, England, and France are re-considering specific settlements and trading ports on the Atlantic and Pacific Rims. Class work will enhance student skills: we shall be discussing exemplary recent historical films and histories and we shall learn how to efficiently find diverse viewpoints through online and printed sources.\nReel History\u00a0\nThis course will examine some of the ways that the history of France has been represented in films. Joan of Arc, The Return of Martin Guerre, Ridicule, The Rise to Power of Louis XIV, Danton La Nuit de Varennes, Abel Gance's Napoleon, and Night and Fog are among the great movie classics to be analyzed. We will also deal with recent theoretical work on \"historical\" cinema. Are images as valid as written text when making meaningful connections with the past?\nWriting the History of the Middle East\u00a0\nThis course is a junior seminar on recent developments in the research and writing of history as practiced by professional historians of the modern Middle East. We will look at the history of historical writing about the region and the transformative developments in the field over the last thirty years or so. The objective is to cultivate your awareness of historiography and historical criticism. Historiography can be defined as the history of historical interpretation. Historical criticism refers to how we understand history as an object of study. To appreciate various modes of inquiry in the field, we will read exemplary texts embodying established traditions and new departures as well as critical works on the ideological roots of particular fields of history.\nWriting World History\nThis junior seminar investigates various approaches to writing world history. The course is designed to help history majors understand historiography and historical criticism. By studying recent approaches to world history, students will learn how historical debate shapes the writing of history, how historians approach and critique each other's work, and how different styles of historical research and writing have developed over time.",

In this course, we will draw on colonial and postcolonial theory to reinterpret these stories in the historical context of a set of encounters involving the Americas and the Americans - native and immigrant, from Europe, Asia, and Africa - with the rest of the world, contacts that began in 1492 and are still going on today. In the process, we will explore a diverse array of borderlands between people, environments, mythologies, and histories - spaces of interaction and reinvention. But these borderland spaces are fragile; contact zones devolve, again and again, into conquest, domination, genocide, and empire. Although this is a transnational phenomenon, this course is primarily concerned with the frontier in North America and particularly in the American West and in California.

In fact, the controversy\u00a0has a long history which\u00a0goes back at least as the \"Quarrel between the Ancients and the Moderns\" at the end of the 17th Century\u00a0and extends to Matthew Arnold's Victorian-era debate with T.H. Huxley over whether science has eclipsed the need for humanities.\u00a0In the United States there has been an ongoing skirmish over what to read in our universities that stretches from President Eliot's decision\u00a0to abandon the core curriculum at Harvard for an open,\u00a0elective system in the 1880s, to the furor that erupted with the publication of Allan Bloom's\u00a0The Closing of the American Mind\u00a0a century later. More recently Dan-el Padilla Peralta--a\u00a0professor of Roman History at Princeton--has advocated for abolishing the founding discipline of Classics altogether because of its entanglement with the\u00a0origin story of white supremacy.\u00a0\u00a0At the bottom of the debate over the canon\u00a0is the assumption that what we teach and read defines the culture as a whole, what we value, and who we are. It is a debate\u00a0over the tradition's\u00a0exclusivity and chauvinism.\u00a0 But it is also a debate over the relevance of the humanities in a world dominated by science and\u00a0the rigorous demands of preprofessional training--which is to say that it is a debate over modernity itself. Finally--and perhaps most controversially--it is\u00a0debate over a putative ideal of \"greatness\" and \"civilization,\" along with the role of the University in perpetuating that ideal, even as it plays the largely unexamined role of selecting leadership within a democracy. Clearly, much is at stake. This course will examine the many sides of this longstanding controversy among canon's\u00a0advocates, critics and reformers. We will also examine the attempt to\u00a0institutionalize various curricular models such as the Great Books program at Columbia University and the Athens-America program at University of Wisconsin (both in the 1920s), as well as the Experimental College at Berkeley in the 1960s.

    "description": "China is now undergoing one of the fastest rates of urbanization in world history. Just thirty years ago, about 80% of the Chinese population lived in the countryside, mostly working in agriculture. Today, China's population is over half urban, and the CCP has announced a new plan to speed up the urbanization process so that by 2020, 60% will be urban. Furthermore, well over 100 million migrants travel back and forth between the countryside and the city each year. While these numbers are impressive in and of themselves, it can be hard to understand what they mean for individuals, for particular social groups, and for the changing rural and urban landscapes. Nonetheless, this shift from a predominantly rural population to an urban focused society is both ambitious and fraught with problems. This class aims to give an in-depth and up\u00ad-close look at this amazing social transformation through readings, class lectures, film, research projects, and, most importantly, in-country experience. This course begins with a short semester on campus at Occidental and continues with a three\u00ad-week trip to China, including a home\u00adstay with a rural household.

Beginning with the rise of Third-Worldism in the mid-1950s and ending in the 1970s, this period of radicalism reached its height with the tumultuous Cultural Revolution in China (1966-1969). Through memoirs, primary source material from the time, film, and secondary sources we will investigate why after years of political and economic consolidation the People\u2019s Republic of China underwent such a dramatic and chaotic political upsurge. We will end the course by looking at the influence of China\u2019s Cultural Revolution on the radical 1960s movements of the world, in particular in the United States and France and peasant movements in the third world.",

The variety of natural and built environments in Mesoamerica has produced a diversity of social, cultural, and political landscapes. This seminar explores the ways in which different cultural groups have perceived, used, managed, and conserved the Mesoamerican environment from colonial times to the present. We will address a number of interrelated questions about the relationship between Mesoamerican societies and the environment. How have natural environments established parameters for human economic and social activity? How have Mesoamericans interpreted and then reshaped their environmental surroundings to satisfy their supposed needs? What impact have race and gender had on perceptions of the environment? What have been the environmental consequences of the colonial, subsistence, and agro-export economies the 19th century infatuation with progress and the 20th century creation of industrial and urban conglomerations under the aegis of developmentalist ideologies? What is the historical geography of five centuries of sustained degradation and sporadic conservation of Mesoamerica's bio-physical environments? How have different groups of Latin Americans interacted in their quest to manage, control, and distribute natural resources? We will pay particular attention to how the relationship between humans and their natural and built environments shaped Mesoamerica's social and political development.",

According to this view sectarian (and ethnic) identities are static and consist of an unchanging essential core not only independent of historical, political and economic developments, but indeed even generative of them. For some, the Lebanese Civil War of 1975-1990 seemed to confirm the \u201csectarian thesis\u201d about the Middle East. \u00a0Indeed, the war-torn Lebanese capital, Beirut (divided as it was between an eastern \u201cChristian\u201d enclave and a western \u201cMuslim\u201d enclave), became a metonym for sectarian conflict.

    "description": "The Democrats, Jefferson to Biden \nThis course proceeds from the assumption that the history of a political party still matters to the course of the United States of America in the 2020s. As such, we will investigate the key lives, events, and movements that have shaped the Democratic Party, from its founding in the 1790s through the present day. At the same time, given the Democratic Party\u2019s troubled legacy on questions of race, gender, sexuality, and class, the usefulness of the party as a vehicle for societal change must be questioned. The course will attend to these concerns by studying the party\u2019s most important leaders, conventions, elections, and movements. Together we will learn how a history of a political party\u2014and especially of who is included and who is excluded\u2014reveals the contours of American democracy itself.\nAmerican History According to Hollywood\nThis class investigates the way movies have shaped Americans\u2019 understanding of their history. Surveying major developments across the twentieth century and into our own, we will examine films as imaginative primary sources that reveal the attitudes and anxieties of past eras (e.g. concerns about race and ethnicity, global power, gender and sexuality). The last third of the class will turn to a more intensive focus on the way movies have functioned as secondary sources, offering powerful (if partial) interpretations of earlier eras. Here students will focus on a select number of topics or events (e.g. the immigrant experience, WWII, \u201cthe West\u201d) and trace the changing historical interpretations the films present. Ultimately, we will evaluate how \u201ccinematic history\u201d compares to \u201cwritten history\u201d and by what interpretive or evidentiary standards or criteria we should evaluate it.\nDisneyland and Los Angeles\nIn the summer of 1955, amidst the orange groves of Southern California and next to a brand-new freeway, Disneyland Park appeared. Broadcast across the country through a hit television program that premiered the previous year, the new theme park became an instant national media sensation, drawing on a long and varied tradition of American popular amusements. But, it was also an institution with deep roots in the specific culture and history of greater Los Angeles itself. In this course, we will trace the complex dialogue between the iconic amusement park and its urban environment in Southern California over the last half of the 20th century, carefully analyzing urban and social history, film, and literature to discover what Disneyland can teach us about the history, built environment, and culture of the strange, sprawling megalopolis that surrounds it.\u00a0\nCore Requirement Met: United States Diversity",

This course will explore the shifting conceptions of metamorphosis -- the transformation of \"forms [...] into new bodies,\" and vice versa - from its mythic origins in Ovid to its modern manifestations and modulations in the works of Goethe, Darwin, and Kafka. Throughout the course, we will examine the ambiguous relationship between \"forms\" and \"bodies\" in Western thought and how the permutations of this nexus come to bear on a wide variety of different topics in the humanities, including myths and theories of changing forms in nature (plants, clouds, animals); dynamic representations of gender, sexuality, and erotics; as well as figures of hybridity and the grotesque (human-animal hybrids, beasts, and monstrosities). More broadly, the course will explore the porous interfaces between ancient and modern poetics, myth and modernity, as well as the arts and sciences.

In so doing, it attempts to recover the largely forgotten perspectives, experiences, interests, voices, and cultures of non-elite people in the Roman world, that is, the entire Mediterranean from 133 B.C.E. to 476 C.E. Today, we usually see Roman history and culture from the perspective of Rome\u2019s elites, because the bulk of the surviving texts were written by or for elites. We shall steer a different course, examining texts and material artifacts produced by, for, or about ordinary people. Topics include Roman childhood and the Roman family, kinship relations, mothering and motherhood, child-rearing practices, children\u2019s experience, the death of kin and commemorative practices; the economic circumstances of ordinary Romans, the nature of work, the terms of lending and borrowing, the experiences and cultures of slave-holding and of enslavement; women\u2019s roles as girl (puella), girlfriend (amica), wife (matrona), prostitute (meretrix), and witch (venefica); sex, sexuality, and dirty songs; the people\u2019s entertainments, such as theater, games, gladiator shows, and popular literature; popular politics and the role of the crowd and common person in public life; the culture of soldiering and the experience of peoples at the borders of empire; popular religious phenomena and the appeal of prophets, priests, and holy men in such movements as Isis worship, Mithraism, and Christianity. The goal of the course is for students to emerge with a holistic understanding of the details of and scholarly theories about non-elite culture in the Roman world, and hence with a heightened ability to identify and critically analyze contemporary discourses about \u201clow\u201d versus \u201chigh\u201d culture, which most often remain entirely implicit.",

For him, reality consisted of atoms and compounds of atoms situated in empty space. We will try to come to grips with Lucretius'\u00a0answers to questions such as the following: Where, in a purely physical world, is there a place for conscious beings like ourselves? Can we have free will and if so, how? Why do we suffer and what can we do to escape suffering? What makes life meaningful if the soul is not immortal? What does it mean to be a moral person if the gods take no interest in us or our actions? What do we owe each other, as creatures living\u00a0together in community? As we examine these questions we will also attend carefully to Lucretius'\u00a0poetic artistry, to the\u00a0rhetorical strategies by which he attempts to convert his audience, to his atomic physics, and to his place as a political thinker writing during the fall of the Roman republic. In this 5-unit course we will be reading Lucretius\u00a0in the original Latin, and will address the ways in which his poem's semantic content, syntax, and literary form work with (or against) one another to produce that texture of Roman cultural significance that is the\u00a0de Rerum.\u00a0Permission of instructor required.",

Cognitive science offers explanatory paradigms for everything from the appeal of literary characters, dramatic irony, belief in gods, and animal sacrifice. Distributed cognition, that is, the thesis that cognition is embodied, enactive, embedded, and extended is appealed to for new perspectives on ancient theater, public spectacles, religious ceremonies, craft knowledge, and the production, display, and appreciation of architectural forms, sculpture, and paintings. Findings from the science of memory are brought to bear upon Roman strategies for remembering, for commemorating, and for purposely forgetting. Theories of culture drawn from evolutionary anthropology, developmental psychology, and philosophy of biology are adduced to cast new light on our evidence for Roman forms of participatory rather than instructional pedagogy, in-group / out-group formation,\u00a0prosocial and altruistic behavior, and mechanisms of cultural change. These topics will be examined through close readings in the original Latin drawn from\u00a0Cato the Elder, Cicero, Livy, Vitruvius, and others. Permission of instructor required.",

    "description": "After the era of Plato and Aristotle (4th century BCE), Greek and Roman philosophers centered the therapy of psychological suffering in their philosophical programs. Epicurus, for example, wrote, \u201cThere is no use in philosophy, unless it casts out the suffering of the soul.\u201d In this course, we examine the therapeutic programs offered by various ancient philosophical schools: the Peripatetics (followers of Aristotle), Stoics (followers of Zeno of Citium), Epicureans (followers of Epicurus), Skeptics (two schools, one descending from Plato\u2019s Academy and the other from Pyrrho), and finally the Christian philosophy of Augustine of Hippo, which was informed by but also broke decisively with the Greco-Roman philosophical tradition that had preceded it. In order to understand the therapeutic programs of these schools, we shall first have to understand each school\u2019s account of human nature (\u201canthropology,\u201d in its original sense), of the mind or soul (\u201cpsychology,\u201d in its original sense), and of the purpose or \u201cend\u201d of human existence (\u201cethics\u201d). Each school\u2019s answer to the question of why we suffer and how we might find psychological peace\u00a0only makes sense in light of that school\u2019s beliefs about what it is to be human, what is the nature of the mind/soul, and what is the purpose of life. Our source materials in this investigation will include classic texts in ancient ethical thought: Cicero\u2019s Tusculan Disputations, a literary masterpiece cast as a dialogue among prominent Romans who had sought refuge in the countryside as the end of the Roman republic unfolded; Seneca\u2019s On tranquility of mind, which takes the form of a letter to his friend Serenus, who had sought him out to find relief from his distress; and the third book of Augustine\u2019s Confessions, which details the author\u2019s suffering under the afflictions of lust and the apparent paradox of his perverse delight in his own misery.\nTaught in conjunction with\u00a0CSLC 247, but meeting for an additional section.",

Pompey\u2019s military leadership had been the republicans\u2019 last hope of preserving Rome\u2019s constitutional order in the face of the dictatorial ambitions of Julius Caesar, who had in effect declared war on his own country in 49 B.C.E when he brought his army across the Rubicon river into Italy from Gaul. With Pompey gone, the republic was lost.\n\nSome Romans\u2014including the statesman, orator, and philosopher Marcus Tullius Cicero\u2014resisted Caesar with the pen, not the sword. In works such as On the Republic and On the Laws, Cicero articulated and urged upon his fellow citizens the merits of republican government, its basis in popular sovereignty, and the moral and political virtues of the rule of laws not men. A group of republican conspirators who sought to restore the old order assassinated Caesar in 44 B.C.E. They were, in turn, destroyed by Caesar\u2019s would-be heirs. In the tumult, Cicero was assassinated by the Caesarian faction for his political speech and activism.\n\nCicero\u2019s writings and their influence survived his assassination and have inspired opponents of tyranny and proponents of self-government for over 2000 years. In this course, we engage with the legacy of Roman republicanism, and its historically unprecedented regime of rights, laws, and constitutional norms. We read foundational texts by Cicero and the Roman historian Livy as well as by later political theorists who drew inspiration from them, such as Machiavelli, who re-introduced the theory of republican government into a Renaissance Europe ruled by princes in his 1517 treatise Discourses on Livy, and John Adams (the \u201cAmerican Cicero\u201d), whose 1787 work Defence of the Constitutions of the United States of America owed much to Ciceronian thought and made the Constitution that we have today\u2014the oldest constitution in the world, and one that many perceive as now under threat\u2014the world-changing document that it has proved to be.",

    "description": "This course investigates select African American engagements with the literatures produced by ancient Greeks and Romans. It is motivated by the conviction that we do interpretive justice to the accomplishments of African American writers when we attempt to understand the tradition(s) they conceive their work to be intervening in.\nAfrican American literature was born with the publication of Phillis Wheatley\u2019s Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral, in 1773. The book evinces a deep knowledge of Latin and Latin literature, which it turns to its own emancipatory end. Indeed, Wheatley secured her freedom on the strength of the book.\nEngagement with classical texts offered Wheatley and other African American writers of every era an opportunity to access, deploy, and transform a widely shared treasury of meanings, ideas, images, tropes, genres, and styles in order to create unique works of great artistic power, capable of opening up newly imagined ways of being for themselves and their readers. In addition to Wheatley, we shall explore the classical interactions of poets such as James M. Bell, Mary Livermore, Frances Ellen Watkins, and Robert Hayden and prose writers such as David Walker, William Sanders Scarborough, and W. E. B. Du Bois.\nTo experience the artistic power of these works as their authors intended, we must understand the aesthetic and literary contexts and tradition(s) in which they worked, for context and tradition are the foundation of a work\u2019s meaning. To this end, we shall read alongside African American literary creations some of the Greek and Roman literary works to which they respond. For when we see clearly how a poem by, for example, Phillis Wheatley, responds to an ode by the Roman poet Horace\u2014himself the son of a freedman\u2014we grasp more fully the unique aesthetic, moral, and intellectual power of her poem. To see how Horace\u2019s poetry could communicate to Wheatley is to see how Wheatley\u2019s poetry can communicate its emancipatory power and promise to us in our own time.",

The course will be organized around historical case studies including medical inspection and quarantine of Southern and Eastern European and Asian immigrants at Ellis and Angel Islands and Mexicans at the U.S. border in the 1890s-1930s; race and epidemics in early twentieth century cities; mental health of European and Latin American political refugees in the post-World War II era; farm worker health and environmental justice movements since the 1960s; forced deportation of Caribbean migrants for HIV-positive status during the AIDS pandemic; maternal and reproductive health in post-1990s detention centers; and mutual aid during the COVID-19 crisis, among others. Taken together, students will discern how migration serves as a determinant of health, and also learn about migrant resilience despite structural violence. The themes of medical racism and scapegoating, contagion narratives, occupational health, health movements, cross-cultural health communication, and medical citizenship will anchor course units. With particular attention to the analytical categories of race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and class, the course posits that history can make a critical contribution to our understanding of health inequities and to the development of migrant health justice.

In what ways have religious communities lead organized resistances? And even when mobilizing for liberation, to what extent can religion continue to solidify forms of oppression?

In the current climate of the #metoo and #timesup campaigns and revelations of sexual harassment in the Hollywood film industry, where does the Japanese film industry stand? This course will look at Japanese cinematic history whose roots are embedded in the studio system in Kyoto and consider how the role of women in film has been shaped by a changing society\u2019s values and norms. The contributions from Japanese female film directors such as the pioneers Sakane Tazuko and actress-director Tanaka Kinuyo to their contemporary counterparts such as award-winning Kawase Naomi, the pink films of Hamano Sachi, relationship driven films of Mishima Yukiko, to the fashionable flair of Ninagawa Mika.\u00a0 We will look at emerging female filmmakers such as Oda Kaori, Endo Maiko, and media artist Sputniko! who are using the format of the moving image to engage Japanese audiences in global issues. In addition to looking closely at works from female film directors, the course will examine tropes and representations of iconic actresses within Japanese cinematic history to appropriation of Japanese culture in pop music videos. Additional Core Requirement Met: Regional Focus.\nCultures of Protest\nThe English word\u00a0protest\u2013 \u201cto declare publicly\u201d \u2013 derives from a Latin verb meaning \u201cto testify, give witness.\u201d In this course we will explore a variety of films from different geopolitical regions and of different genres and different historical contexts that might be interpreted as speaking to all kinds of modalities of protest: protests against nationalisms, against ethnic cleansings, against xenophobia, racism, and homophobia, against national violence and against gender purity. We will engage with different understandings of the concept of protest and focus on its relation to migration, foreignness, national identity, racial, gender, and sexual politics, border politics, globalization, and various philosophical discussions (about difference, multiculturalism and diversity). The course is discussion-based, encouraging critical thinking, writing, and presentation skills.\u00a0\u00a0Expect theoretical readings and that will guide our explorations.\nFrom Cyborgs to Siri: Gender, Technology and Media\nIn this course, we will examine the humanoid robots, cyborgs, and AIs imagined in film, television, and advertising, as well as the dialogue between these fictional creations and their real-life counterparts, from historical automata to the current development of robotic and virtual assistants and companions. How does techno-fantasy inform material reality, and vice versa, in the construction of these figures? What roles do we ask them to play in both realms? What social, cultural and historical conditions give rise to, and shape, their appearance? What cultural hopes and fears do they reveal?

What realities might be uniquely explored or represented using varying modes of animation, either as part of a larger documentary project or as the entire project itself? Students will explore creative strategies for designing form and content across\u00a0experimental, abstract, and character based approaches. A series of collaborative, hands-on media projects will be supplemented by discussions of theoretical readings, screenings, and technical workshops. Recommended (though not required): MAC 110 and\u00a0MAC 210.\nProcess-Based Mediamaking\nA hands-on media production course in which the final result of each project is, to some extent, outside of the creator\u2019s control. \u00a0The vast majority of traditional film and television is intentionally scripted or planned in advance and the production/filmmaking process is focused on capturing images and sound that perfectly execute that script or plan. Process-Based Mediamaking is an alternative to this system. It is rooted in the idea of developing a process, methodology, or set of rules ahead of time and then letting that open-ended, exploratory, and in some cases even random, approach generate media art. This course will consider historical and current examples of Process-Based mediamaking but the main emphasis of the course is the creation of this kind of media. No prior mediamaking experience is required.\nExploring 360\u00ba Video and Immersive Installations\nDo 360 video cameras, VR headsets, and immersive screen installations represent a paradigmatic change in production, artistic conception, and audience experience? This course will introduce students to the foundational methods, technology, aesthetic approaches, and cultural and ethical considerations of live-action immersive media creation for both VR headsets and video installations. Students will work in a collaborative environment to conceive and execute a series of projects using 360 video cameras and traditional digital video cameras.

Different topics may satisfy different Core requirements.\nNew Waves of East Asian Cinema\nThe history of cinema is marked by New Waves reflecting both artistic and cultural movements and shifts in cinematic practice. This survey course focuses on the New Waves of East Asian Cinema, engaging their sociocultural history alongside aesthetic and technological developments. Topics include: Japan\u2019s\u00a0N\u016bberu b\u0101gu\u00a0in the 1950s, which borrowed its name from the inaugural movement of the French\u00a0Nouvelle Vague;\u00a0the waves in Hong Kong cinema, which were thematically linked to the impending expiration date of the 1997 handover to China; and the developments in Taiwanese art and film that were spurred by the ending of martial law in 1982. We will examine the historical events of resistance underlying these cinematic movements and their long-lasting impacts on society and culture. Students will engage with the material critically through projects and presentations alongside weekly screenings, readings, and discussions. Additional Requirement Met: Regional Focus.\nModernity and the Rise of Cinematic Visuality\nMany have argued that the history of modernity has been, above all, a history of visualization, changing the way we see. In this course, we will examine a diverse range of nineteenth and early twentieth century visual practices, technologies, and experiences including train rides, panoramas, shopping arcades, assembly lines, and amusement parks that helped shape the \"modern observer\" by altering both the perception and understanding of time and space, public and private, work and leisure, the normal and deviant, and the individual and collective. Through a combination of critical readings, screenings, and field trips, we will ask how such practices of looking not only influenced early cinematic form and content, but also how they continue to inflect postmodern media culture, from television to the internet. The course culminates in a 3D screening of HUGO (2011, Scorsese).\nThe Philosophy of Classical Hollywood Cinema\nThis course will attempt a survey of current philosophical approaches to classical Hollywood film, beginning with Stanley Cavell\u2019s The World Viewed: Reflections on the Ontology of Cinema (1971). This work initiated a new and flourishing sub-discipline within contemporary academic philosophy called film-philosophy. The central assumption within this body of inquiry is that film is (or can be) \u201cphilosophy in action.\u201d In this course we will be returning to the source of this idea to read Cavell\u2019s original work, as well as selections from his two subsequent books: Pursuits of Happiness: the Hollywood Comedy of Remarriage (1981) and Contesting Tears: The Hollywood Melodrama of the Unknown Woman (1996). We will then extend our inquiry to other writers inspired by Cavell (and reflections on later developments within Hollywood), such as Robert Pippin (writing on Film Noir), Stephen Mulhall (writing on the Alien series and other sci-fi), and William Rothman (writing on Hitchcock). Weekly screenings and discussions will be part of the course, as well as one or two field trips to Los Angeles archives. Cross-listed as PHIL 317.",

To inhabit this category and feel its weight? We know that certain bodies, or regions, are labeled as foreign, but also texts and images. \u201cForeign\u201d is a sticky term \u2013 it sticks to the body of a human, or to a particular image or sound \u2013 and it marks it as something else, as something other than me, alien, some form of alterity.

Classes will include screenings, lectures, discussion, and hands-on experiences in producing and collaborating on digital media projects. Topics courses may be repeated with a different topic for credit.\nMedia Activism through Participatory Video\nThis is a combined theory and practice course that will engage students in looking critically at what participation means when working with members of a community. In participatory video, who holds the camera often determines who holds the power. By gaining an understanding of documentary film and ethics, we will question the relationship between filmmaker and subject. \u00a0Students will learn about working with community, developing relationships and trust, and how to collaborate using participatory methods. Through readings,\u00a0screenings, and guest lectures, the course will explore the potential of using digital media tools to engage communities in media activism.\u00a0Students will be introduced to a variety of methodologies that will lead up to a final collaborative project that will engage a local community in participatory video. This final project will result in\u00a0 a series of public workshops, screenings, and exhibition.\nVisual Design and Composition for Media\nThis theory/practice\u00a0course introduces and deepens student fluency in design methods for communicating concepts and stories visually using cinematic and emerging media formats. Students will closely examine current and historical examples of how formal visual design components communicate non-verbal content and information - composition, color, value, line, shape, depth, visual rhythm, camera movement, and more. In addition to critical reflection, students will integrate and demonstrate their learning through the creation of still photographic images, short cinematic sketches, and visual ideation for emerging media. The course also considers how to research, design, and communicate an overall visual structure plan for a project, and how the visual structure relates to and supports other narrative or non-narrative structures. Finally, students will consider how these principles are engaged, extended, and challenged through emerging media forms.\nThe Video Essay\nIn this theory/practice course, we will explore what it means to \u201cthink and write with video\u201d about film, media, and popular culture. Readings, screenings, and class discussions will engage the history of the video essay, including its filmic precursor, \u201cthe essay film\u201d; debates about what makes a video essay scholarly; and a variety of formal, aesthetic, and rhetorical strategies for communicating ideas through moving image and sound. Student work will involve a series of hands-on assignments building towards a scholarly video essay that can be submitted to an on-line journal.\nGame Design Workshop\nThis course will introduce students to the foundational concepts of game design through the practice of creating video games. Video games are products of culture, and this course approaches video games as media artifacts worthy of analysis, critical design, and purpose-focused production. In this course, students will learn digital tools for video game creation, such as an introductory-level game engine, basic programming skills, and audiovisual design. Students will also question and critique theories and foundational practices of game design. Readings, lectures, and in-class exercises will explore the expressive and political possibilities of games as cultural productions. No previous programming or game design experience is required.\nReimagining Social Media Practice\nThis course seeks to dismantle conceptions of the internet and social media as distribution platforms and instead critically and creatively reimagines them as a production medium, one capable of producing unprecedented media content, communities, and cultural interventions. Students will engage with theories of social media and online communities by engaging with projects that explore these issues from a practical hands-on perspective. Students will become social media and online content creators to accomplish three main goals: become literate in the social media content creation process, understand current research and theories on social media and online communities, and transgressively examine the implications of a culture imbued with social media and online content. Topics to be explored in the class include influencer culture, cyberbullying, the Alt Right, strategy, public crises, identity communities, election hacking, fake news, and psychological and social implications of social media use.\nDigital Tools for Radical Change\nThis theory and practice course takes a critical look at the use of media communications and social media in resisting oppression and organizing for social change. Readings, class discussions, and creative assignments will engage a variety of case studies in which digital and social media were used to shape debates, advance causes, build networks, and encourage civic participation, including #BlackLivesMatter, @realdonaldtrump, and the ACLU's Mobile Justice app. Throughout, emphasis will be placed on the art of communication as the single most important aspect of effective community organizing, activism, and advocacy. Students will put theory into practice by conceptualizing, executing, and evaluating a digital advocacy campaign via social media. Their work will be supported by skills-based workshops and class visits with Los Angeles media activists and social media influencers, which will help equip them with practical tools and insight into digital and creative practices for achieving specific goals. This course is being linked to a Cinematheque series and will include a few mandatory screenings on Thursday nights.\u00a0\nRemix Media and Culture Jamming\nWhat is Remix media? Remixing, reusing, and reworking separate media elements from different sources to produce an entirely new work with a different meaning. What is Culture Jamming?\u00a0Coined by Oxy alum '82 Marc Dery, \"culture jamming\" is an anti-consumerist tactic used to disrupt or subvert dominant media culture, including (but not limited to) corporate advertising. This theory/practice course takes a critical look at the history of remix culture\u2014from Dada to Machinima\u2014along with the gamut of aesthetic, political, and social concerns addressed by remix artists and musicians and the reception (and even appropriation) of their work by the corporate entertainment industry. Students will put theory into practice by producing their own remix projects including a subvertisement\u00a0and remix video. We will also explore issues around copyright and fair use in the sampling of both commercial and independently-produced works.\nPublic Media and Alternative Exhibition Strategies\u00a0\nFor over 25 years Anne Bray and her Los Angeles organization\u00a0FREEWAVES\u00a0have created public media art events that bring diverse audiences and independent media artists together in dialogue on current issues in nontraditional, community-focused exhibition contexts. This hands-on course will engage students in theoretically and practically exploring past precedents and future possibilities for innovative and people centered media curation and exhibition. Students will work with Bray to conceptualize and realize alternative public media programming interventions on campus, in Los Angeles, and online, examining critical questions of space/venue, audience/community, and outcome/social engagement.\nMockumentary\nThis hybrid course blends theory, history, and practice to introduce students to the hands-on technical skills in mockumentary film production. Simultaneous to crafting your own video works, students will investigate the longstanding transnational and political history of mockumentary ranging from Bu\u00f1uel to Borat. This analysis of mockumentary also proves invaluable in revealing, denaturalizing, and inspiring many of the conventions of documentary realism. Far from being polemical against documentary, this course not only examines how mockumentary can expose the lies and fakery already at work in claims to objectivity but also highlights the authenticity of film artifice.\nMedia & Social Movements in Los Angeles\nThis theory/practice course focuses on the relationship between media and social justice struggles in the greater Los Angeles region. Readings, class discussions, and creative assignments will address the use of media tools as a form of local and global resistance against various forms of economic, racial, sexual and gender oppression. Students will learn about the theoretical and material tensions between the global political economy and local grassroots media movements, ranging from Asian American video collectives of the 1970s to the Los Angeles School of Black Filmmakers (a.k.a. L.A. Rebellion film movement) of the 1980s. In the latter half of the semester, we will examine contemporary sites of media activism online, including but not limited to #blacklivesmatter, QWOCMAP, and the Asian American Oral History project. Weekly labs will provide opportunities to explore various media forms and strategies in order to critically analyze why certain platforms have emerged within different movements and what political possibilities still resonate. While labs will focus on audiovisual production and social media, there will be room to experiment with other forms of media resistance including \u2018zine-making, comic books, and musical performance (e.g. critical karaoke, flash mobs, etc.). We will be joined throughout the semester by media activists and local community organizers, who will share their perspectives on contemporary struggles and, at times, lead skills-based workshops. The course will culminate in a final project in which students conceptualize and begin to execute a media campaign with a Los Angeles-based community organization. Additional Core Requirement Met: United States\u00a0Diversity.",

It begins with what is known as the \"LA Rebellion,\" a moment of a radical reconceptualization of filmmaking, fostered by black students during their studies at the UCLA film school, and arrives in a present that is characterized by independent film and non-theatrical outlets. Emphasis will be placed on films that express innovation and experimentation. We will trace the evolution (and occasion devolution) of cinematic themes such as the representation of slavery, the depiction of black interiority, representations of gender and sexuality, and the portrayal of race itself. Films we might study include Selma, Fruitvale Station, Daughters of the Dust, Lemonade, Pariah, Bush Mama, Do the Right Thing, and An Oversimplification of Her Beauty.",

    "description": "This intermediate topical course addresses new and evolving issues around digital technologies and networked publics, examining their social, cultural, political, and global ramifications both on- and off-line. Coursework will engage digital media theory and scholarship.\u00a0Topics courses may be repeated with a different topic for credit.\u00a0Note: specific topics may fulfill distinct core requirements.\u00a0\nCritical Game Studies: Aesthetics and Politics \nAre video games addictive? Does video game violence affect people in RL (real life)? Are video games art? Can video games change the world? Even as video games have emerged as a multi-billion dollar media industry, how we discuss them remains contentious. Critics disagree over their status as a \u201cserious\u201d mode of artistic expression, along with their place in the \u201cculture wars\u201d that have shaped the political life of the United States and the world. This course provides students with the intellectual framework and critical vocabulary to examine video games as media texts via aesthetics: the value of gameplay experiences and how we fit them into our lives. How do we play, and why? The course will also address questions of politics: how can games shape, and how are they shaped by, the current of public life? Who gets to play, particularly along the lines of race, gender, sexuality, and class? Live and recorded gameplay demonstrations will provide students with the material for criticism and inquiry, alongside contemporary critical games writing, which will serve as models for student writing projects. Participants do not need previous experience with games or computers, but only a willingness to engage with games and gameplay within a critical context.\nWomen Making Moves - Women\u2019s Migration and Media \nThe course will apply a theoretical and practical framework to facilitate an understanding of gendered migration patterns within Asia with a focus on Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan and the Asian diaspora. This course will be designed to encourage students to critically engage in understanding global migration flows and trends, but to also look closer at more personal narratives of migration. We will discuss forced and voluntary migration, issues of sex work and the emotional labor industry, the crossing of borders, and what it means to belong. The thematic focus will be on the feminization of migration, the monetization of the migrant worker\u2019s body, and looking at how feminist activism is perceived within an Asian context. Students will collaborate on a visual research project that examines themes of migration and how it impacts their daily lives. Additional Core Requirement Met: Global Connections.\nThe Art and Politics of Virtual Reality\nRecent years have seen an explosion in consumer-grade virtual reality (VR) technologies \u2014 devices like the HTC Vive, PlayStation VR, Oculus Rift, and Samsung Gear VR have brought a wealth of new experiences to audiences and users, both inside and outside their homes. The new wave of VR content and hardware may feel unprecedented; in fact, the history of VR begins over a century ago. This course will examine \u201creality\u201d and the \u201cvirtual\u201d, two long-contested terms, through the lenses of history, culture, embodiment, and space. Students will walk the boundaries of \u201cvirtual reality\u201d through readings, screenings, workshops, and VR experiences. Through this work, students will enter the discourse surrounding VR, where they will struggle with the complicated political questions that surround VR as an art form: Who gets to define what is \u2018real\u2019 and what is not? How (and for whom) is something \u2018virtual\u2019? What kinds of rules, procedures, laws, and people should govern these strange spaces and places we call \u201cvirtual reality\u201d? And how can VR be used not simply as a vehicle for entertainment or escape, but also a space for cultural questioning, activism, and social change?\u00a0This course is connected to the Oxy Cinematheque Series that will occur during select evening course sessions.\nIntroduction to Game Studies and Culture\nGames are changing how we create, mediate, and understand our world. This course introduces students to the interdisciplinary field of game studies with a media studies and design focus. Students will read research, play games, analyze games, and think through game design. Students will also examine issues facing gaming culture. A survey of subjects will describe the foundational theories of the field, identities and game culture, and implications/effects of gameplay. Topics to be explored include disability, education and games, cheating, sexuality and games, narratives, addiction, news games, and violence.\nWho Owns the Internet?\nThis course takes a historical, critical, and experiential approach to the competing sets of interests that have struggled over control of the internet since its inception. These players - military, academic, corporate, activist, regulatory, user, etc. - will be explored through sets of readings, screenings, field trips, and hands-on workshops. Central to our inquiry will be questions of infrastructure, surveillance, and resistance, as they mark out the terrain, on which digital culture thrives, and, through which, major actors exert their influence. Students will have the opportunity to both learn about digital cultures and work in digital modes in this course, with hands on components emphasizing geo-spatial analysis, multimedia presentation, social media engagement, and webmaking.",

Worldbuilding refers to designing a complex integrated system with many moving parts such as characters, settings, myths, rules, artifacts \u2013 often a whole system of a society and culture. These design methods are used throughout media forms ranging from narrative writing, filmmaking, theater, architecture, mobile apps, video games, and virtual reality, to the integrated use of multiple forms using transmedia storytelling. Students will create short projects that investigate relationships between the design of a world and the storytelling possibilities that emerge from and are embedded within it, using both analog and digital methods. Students will experiment with methods and concepts such as non-linear storytelling, interactivity, experience design, transmedia, the poetics of space, and other relevant topics.

    "description": "\u201cHaptic\u201d is a word that describes the sense of touch, derived from a Greek root meaning to grasp, perceive, or fasten, and it has been used to describe technologies and aesthetics that communicate, or mediate, this tactile sense. We often think of touch as doing things with our hands, but touch actually affects all parts of the body, and plays a role in smell (particles entering the nose), sound (as vibration or a wave), taste (of the tongue touching), and even vision (through synesthesia or haptic visuality). However, in the current age of social distancing, many of us are feeling \u201ctouch starved,\u201d and looking to digital media as a source of intimacy and community. How can we learn in this moment from haptic technologies, haptic aesthetics, and uses of these in video games, virtual reality, digital-physical art installations, and even early moving pictures? How can we communicate felt experiences as forms of unique knowledge? Drawing from video game studies, humor and gimmicks, feminist film theory, and Black feminist thought, this course takes an interdisciplinary approach to questions of haptic media. Students will complete and give feedback on six short solo haptic pieces and one final collaborative project. The final aim of the course is an exhibition of student work accessible as a web-based virtual exhibition.",

    "description": "The study of film and media has involved disciplinary and interdisciplinary approaches for about half a century. This intermediate topical course of varying emphases studies the key critical terms, issues, and debates in popular media cultural study, including genre study, in relation to specific topics. Readings of film and media examples illustrate how different theories or perspectives can be applied to contemporary pop culture.\nAudiences and Spectators\nMedia is not only enjoyed by solitary viewers, but also by communities of people who come together to celebrate their love of culture. Across the 20th and 21st centuries, media fans have formed clubs, written amateur publications, altered their appearances, and made parodies of their favorite movies and TV shows as ways to express their fandom. This course will explore how audiences have taken pleasure in film, television, and contemporary digital media. Students will examine moving images in a variety of technological formats and exhibition contexts to study how communities of viewers have developed vibrant fan cultures around popular media. Students will also learn how media spectatorship has been structured by racial segregation, class-based accessibility, and other vectors of social inequity. Course screenings will include: The Last Picture Show; Goodbye, Dragon Inn; The Watermelon Woman; and Dawson City: Frozen Time; in addition to user-generated content on platforms such as YouTube, Vine, and TikTok.\nMedia and Your Body\nMedia forms require us to be spectators, audiences, and increasingly, users and participants, in ways that distinctly implicate and impact our bodies and identities. The course examines the nature of bodies, spaces, and materiality in media, specifically examining prominent theories and analyses that illuminate the nature of media as it exists off of the screen. The course will survey how we interact with media in different spaces and how our bodies form a part of the media experience. Specific topics include mobile games, humor and riffing with movies, participatory media, materialism, haptics, television spaces in the home and beyond, disability media studies, performing sexuality, and mental illness and video games. Assignments will engage students in practicing the theories they learn in class.\nGenre in Contemporary Film, TV, and Digital Media\nGenre films were part of Classic Hollywood, but genres started changing in interesting ways as media industries evolved after World War II, with the introduction of television, new technologies that enabled shooting on location or new opportunities with color film, the rise of drive-in movie theaters, and indie or exploitation filmmaking. We will study the shift from classic genre films and theory to hybrid genres and genre revisionism in film/media movements spearheaded by people of color, feminists, and LGBT communities, as well as studios. The focus in the class is on genre theory studied through historical and technological shifts in media production. Screenings will introduce a range of genres, from classic films like the Western and noir to more recent genres like road films, television melodramas, and war video games.\nImagining War: Genre on Screen and Battlefield\nThe war film has arguably been one of the most consistent and popular elements of cinema's history. It was a component of film from its beginnings and is now a regular mainstay amongst Hollywood blockbusters. It has also undergone several political revisions and technological shifts in media production, distribution and exhibition, making it ideally suited to study the theory and history of genre. Importantly, this course will not only look at how war figures in film, but how film also profoundly effects and configures war. Entertainment and war are the United States' primary exports. Militarism and the Hollywood studio system have had a long and deadly interdependence. By conceiving of the viewing screen as an extension of the battlefield (and vice versa), this course will look at the profound social and political implications of the classic genre system. We will do this by examining such films as Apocalypse Now, The Deer Hunter, Hiroshima Mon Amour, Battle of Algiers, Black Hawk Down, Kandahar, Night and Fog, The Hurt Locker. Das Boot, Saving Private Ryan, All Quiet on the Western Front, Dr. Strangelove, Inglourious Basterds, Birth of a Nation, Rambo, MASH, as well as a host of television shows, websites, and video games\nThe Western: From Colonialism to Gaming\nThis course will primarily explore the classic Hollywood genre system through a detailed look at \"The Western.\" However, before looking at how genre operates within cinema, we take a broad historical and theoretical examination of genre within literary studies, critical theory, Wild West shows, philosophy, travel literature, ethnographic photography, and cultural studies. The aim is to critically examine a wide array of generic conventions within \"The Western\" film, while simultaneously situating these conventions within the broader historical and ideological context of European colonization of North America. Particular attention will be placed on the role of racial and gender performances within \"The Western\" genre as both a founding American myth and a component of the Hollywood film system. We will analyze both the classic Western as well as revisionist films. Additionally, we will investigate how the genre transforms as it moves into other media, including fine art, television, gaming, and other digital contexts.",

The first part of this course\u00a0 will cover the main topics surrounding the topology, theory, and applications of metric spaces and their morphisms. In particular we will study certain function spaces that arise as normed vector spaces. Completeness, separability, compactness, and connectedness are some of the themes that will appear throughout the course. Fundamental results in Analysis such as the Heine-Borel Theorem, the Baire Category Theorem, the Bernstein Approximation Theorem, the Stone-Weierstrass Theorem, and the Arzela-Ascoli Theorem will be proved and applied. The second part of this class will be devoted to developing the Lebesgue measure on the real line and the Lebesgue integral along with powerful convergence theorems. Time permitting we will study some Fourier series.\nPrerequisite: MATH 310 \u00a0or permission of instructor.\nAdvanced Differential Equations\u00a0\nThe course will consist of advanced topics in differential equations not usually seen in either ordinary differential equations or partial differential equations, such as: delay differential equations and stochastic differential equations. Boundary value problems, numerical methods, and infinite series solutions.\u00a0\nPrerequisite: MATH 340 or MATH 342 or permission of instructor.\u00a0\nKnot Theory\nHow knots are described mathematically, how one can distinguish different knots, create new knots, classify knots. Topics include: Reidemeister moves, links, knot colorings, alternating knots, braids, knots and graphs, knot invariants, mirror images, unknotting, number crossing, number applications to biology and chemistry.\nPrerequisite: MATH 210, MATH 212, or MATH 214 or permission of instructor",

Familiarity with a programming language is highly desirable but not required. The goal of this course is to provide students with an experience of what it is like to work as a mathematician in a professional setting.\nMathematical Modeling\nThis course is a project-oriented seminar in mathematical modeling. Concepts from calculus, linear algebra, differential equations and other areas of mathematics will be used to derive, describe and solve mathematical models from the life, physical, and social sciences. Familiarity with a programming language is desirable but not required. The goal of this course is to provide students with multiple examples of how mathematics can be used to explain various phenomena, to describe real-world situations and to make (more quantitatively) informed decisions.\nApplied Mathematics\nThis weekly seminar course is an introduction to some of the classic techniques of applied mathematics. Topics will include scaling, dimensional analysis, regular and singular perturbations, and asymptotic matching. The goals of the course are to expose students to important techniques widely used in applied mathematics; to present a different mode of classroom instruction and student involvement where students see themselves as equal participants in the learning process; to provide students with opportunities to practice and hone oral presentation skills; and to become more familiar with using modern computational tools to solve mathematical problems.",

Cryptographic\u00a0capabilities are important to politics and foreign affairs, and underlie the functioning of a great deal of\u00a0the modern economy. In this course we will study the mathematical theories and techniques that make\u00a0cryptography function, and also those that break it. We will learn how these mathematical tools influence\u00a0the use of cryptographic systems, and practice explaining these implications to people without developed\u00a0mathematical backgrounds.\nHistory of Mathematics (Euler to Uhlenbeck)\nThis weekly seminar course is a survey of selected topics in the history of mathematics. The Spring semester seminar will cover Euler to Mirzhakani and Uhlenbeck. Through exposure and access to primary historical sources and other materials, students will gain deeper insights into mathematical concepts they have seen before, be introduced to new mathematical ideas, and learn about the history and development of mathematics as it used today. The objective of the course is for students to synthesize and connect various mathematical ideas as a capstone experience for the major.

The integers are not the only interesting set of numbers to work with though.\u00a0 For instance, suppose you are interested in solutions to the equation . This naturally leads us to consider the number  as well. We can then define a new collection of numbers called the Gaussian integers  which consist of elements of the form  for .\u00a0 Given a prime , we also have . Is  still prime in ? It turns out that sometimes, but not always! For instance, in  we have  and , but  is still prime! This fact is related to writing  as a sum of two squares as well as how the polynomial  factors when considered modulo .\u00a0 The study of how primes factor when considered in larger rings is referred to as algebraic number theory. In this course we will study algebraic number theory for the simplest cases of  and possibly other rings of the form  to see the underpinnings of the overall vast theory.\u00a0\u00a0\nMathematical Applications of Linear Algebra\nWe will use the book\u00a0Thirty-three Miniatures: Mathematical and Algorithmic Applications of Linear Algebra, by Ji\u0159\u00ec Matou\u0161ek.\u00a0 We will concentrate mostly on the mathematical applications (as opposed to the algorithmic applications).\u00a0 In the first two class meetings we will learn about (generalized) vector spaces, as preparation for the remainder of the course.",

Topics vary by semester and may satisfy different Core requirements.\nOpera\nSince its inception in late 16th-century Florence as a humanistic reimagining of Greek tragedy, opera has served as a catalyst for social and political change. The opera-loving agents advocating for this change have been diverse: philosophers (Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Friedrich Nietzsche, Kwame Anthony Appiah), writers (Walt Whitman, Langston Hughes, Toni Morrison), and activists (Theodor Herzl, W. E. B. Dubois, Martin Luther King), among many others, including the late jurist Ruth Bader Ginsburg, whose legal career was dedicated\u00a0to advocating for gender equality and women's rights. This iteration of this history-of-opera course will focus on the five operas that Justice Ginsburg wanted people to know: Mozart's Marriage of Figaro\u00a0and Don Giovanni, Verdi's Otello, Puccini's The Girl of the Golden West, and Strauss's Der Rosenkavalier.

Throughout, we will be alert to how differences in these responses are occasioned by historical time, geographical place, culture, race, sex, and class. We will begin in the early nineteenth century with the invention of the stethoscope, which turned close listening to the body as the principal means of detecting tuberculosis. The second unit of the course will study the disabling effects of TB on the composer-pianist Fryderyk Chopin, how he developed a piano method to accommodate that disability, and how the public perceived his music because of his illness. The third unit will study nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century musical stage representations of tuberculosis\u2014the operas La Traviata, The Tales of Hoffmann, La Boh\u00e8me, and The Fall of the House of Usher\u2014and consider them in terms of gender, class, health care, and moral codes.

The emergence of this tonal system enables instrumental music to sustain a listener's attention through dramatic forms and without the aid of words; comprehending how these forms behave is one of the central tasks of this course. In turn, the cultivation of instrumental genres will fuel the operatic accomplishments of Classical composers, notably Mozart. Our study of vocal and instrumental music proceeds chronologically and focuses on individual cities, starting with Florence at the end of the Renaissance and ending with Vienna, the music of Beethoven and Schubert, and the emergence of musical Romanticism.

From the songs of the African American freedom struggle to the music of the nueva cancion movement in Chile, from the live performance practice of the Occupy and immigrant rights movements to the raucous sounds of Russia's Pussy Riot, music has been an important mode of circulating alternative political messages and inspiring rebellion against the status quo. How can music be used to convey political messages and extend the reach of social movements? Why does music enhance cohesion and solidarity among movement participants and/or sway or destabilize oppositional forces? Are there differences between mass-mediated modes of political protest and live, grassroots political performances? When voices raised in song become powerful, what protocols are established to censor and repress them? We will examine these questions in the context of social movements which have inspired mass participation, comparing and contrasting case studies from Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas.

    "description": "A detailed examination of some central philosophical texts from history of Western philosophy. Topics vary by semester. Different topics may satisfy different Core requirements.\nOckham's Manifesto: Language and Ontology in the\u00a0Summary of Logic\nThe\u00a0Summary of Logic\u00a0by William of Ockham (ca. 1287\u20131347) has been called \"a manifesto masquerading as a textbook.\" In addition to teaching a revamped system of Aristotelian logic based on the semantic properties of signification and supposition, Ockham's\u00a0Summary\u00a0also outlines a metaphysical program that revolutionized late medieval philosophy. This program came to be known as 'nominalism', with 'realism' being its adversary. Ockham's own brand of nominalism recognizes only particulars \u2013 as opposed to universals \u2013 belonging to the Aristotelian categories of substance and quality. So among the things that exist are Kiki the cat and the grayness of her fur, but not any general felinity or gray color in virtue of which she's a gray cat. This ontological reduction is grounded in an innovative linguistic analysis involving the semantics of connotation and the theory of mental language: 'cat' signifies particular cats, not catness-in-general, and 'gray' signifies particular gray things while connoting the particular graynesses that they have. In this class, we'll investigate this doctrine along with the overall relationship between language and ontology in Ockham's\u00a0Summary, reading much of Book I along with supplementary material from Ockham's other works and from other philosophers in Ockham's context.\u00a0\nMedieval and Early Modern Philosophical Theology\nIn pursuit of wisdom, most philosophers throughout history thoughtfully engaged in a project of philosophical theology. Differing from religion, theology \u2013 the study (logos) of god (theos) \u2013 critically examines the existence, features, powers, and effects of deities. Some of the most sophisticated approaches to these issues were proposed by medieval and early modern philosophers living between about 1000 and 1800 CE. In this class, we'll try to understand the theological views of a variety of philosophers of this period. Topics will include arguments for the existence of a god in the Latin and Arabic traditions, philosophical mysticism in medieval women philosophers, and the metaphysics and logic of the sacrament of the eucharist.\u00a0Additional\u00a0Core Requirements Met: Global Connections.\nThe Myth of Dualism\nThere are bodies and minds, and the two are fundamentally distinct. Bodies are spatial, publicly observable, and subject to mechanical laws. Minds are spectral, private, and, when things go right, observant of the rules of good reasoning and purposeful action. People are unions of the two\u2014 ghost-piloted machines whose constituents, once separated by bodily death, have very different fates: the abandoned vessel decays, while the captain somehow survives. Or so says the myth of dualism, attributed to the 17th-century French philosopher Ren\u00e9 Descartes by the 20th-century British philosopher Gilbert Ryle, who argues extensively against the \"official doctrine\" of Cartesian Dualism. But Descartes, ingenious as he was, didn't think in a vacuum. He absorbed and perpetuated an intellectual tradition stretching from Classical Greece, to the Golden Age of Islam, to the European Middle Ages, and into Modernity\u2014crude labels for internally diverse and complexly interrelated periods of philosophical history. In the first part of this course, we'll try to locate and trace the myth throughout this roughly two-thousand-year stretch. Our approach will be chronological, and we'll study the views of numerous philosophers, including Plato, Aristotle, Al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, Ibn S\u012bn\u0101, Thomas Aquinas, Teresa of \u00c1vila, Descartes, Pierre Gassendi, Elisabeth of Bohemia, Baruch Spinoza, and Anton Wilhelm Amo. In the second part of the course, we'll consider several approaches to rejecting the paradigm. Forsaking chronology, we'll first attend to Ryle's alternative to dualism\u2014logical behaviorism\u2014before reflecting on an assortment of challenges, raised by Ludwig Wittgenstein, W.E.B. Du Bois, Michel de Montaigne, and N\u0101g\u0101rjuna, to the very idea of an identifiable, unified, or non-illusory self. Additional\u00a0Core Requirements Met: Global Connections.",

While Zeno's paradoxes of motion where first posed about 2000 years ago there is still not a consensus about what to say about them. Semantic paradoxes such as the liar paradox and the paradoxes of vagueness reveal problems with everyday concepts such as truth and implication. Supertasks reveal problems with our understanding of infinity. What to say about these problems what they show us about how to understand space, time, infinity, truth, and reasoning are some of the issues we will discuss in this class. We will examine various paradoxes, puzzles, and purported paradoxes and discuss different proposed resolutions to them.",

Many scholars have rejected the idea that the persistence of a number of racial ills \u2013 like racial inequality, racial discrimination and racial segregation \u2013 in the contemporary moment is evidence that racism also persists as a problem in the twenty-first century. \u201cRacism,\u201d these scholars argue, more accurately describes the Jim Crow South and the people in that era who consciously held explicit beliefs about white superiority over all other races. Though acknowledging changes in racial climate and the terrain of acceptable speech with regards to race, other scholars think that unequal racial outcomes, institutional practices and ideological beliefs connect our contemporary racial problems to racial problems that occurred in the 1960s and earlier. This course is an introduction to the scholarship on racism and has as a central aim to get us to judge together whether \u201cracism\u201d is the appropriate concept to describe and provide a frame through which to understand our contemporary problems concerning race. If it is, which accounts of racism are the most compelling to shed light on our current racial circumstances? What about these accounts are particularly pertinent? What can\u2019t the accounts of racism addressed in class explain? If racism is not the right concept to capture our current struggles with race (or all aspects of it), what concepts if any do a better job and why? To facilitate a critical interrogation of the concept racism, this course will cover sociological, historical, social psychological, philosophical and political accounts of racism and related concepts like racial injustice, racial prejudice, race relations, and racial inequality.\nSub-field:\u00a0AMERICAN POLITICS",

The program is offered during Presidential and Mid-term elections. Students can volunteer for a Republican or Democratic campaign or a \"minor\" party if the campaign is set up to adequately supervise volunteers. The program is open to all Oxy students regardless of major. Students who participate in Campaign Semester take the following three courses (POLS 270, POLS 271, POLS 272) simultaneously. Students will participate in the daily activities of a campaign for United States President or United States Senate in a key \"battleground\" state. Students will gain experience in the highest level of politics and gain an understanding of how a national presidential campaign or a statewide United States Senate campaign is operated. Students will learn about political strategy voter contact and turnout messaging and polling communications volunteer recruitment and team-building fundraising and other key aspects of campaigns. The internship will involve working full-time (a minimum of 40 hours a week) from the first day of class until Election Day. Following that ten-week campaign fieldwork internship students will return to campus and participate in two seminars as part of Campaign Semester. Campaigns involve long hard days. The staff that students will work with will typically be working at least 14-16 hour days. Although students are required to work at least 8 hours a day they are likely to work more. As part of the Campaign Fieldwork Internship students will be required to read three books-biographies of each major party candidate and a book describing previous presidential campaigns. Students will be required to maintain an internship journal that will be handed in at the end of the 10-week internship. The journal will describe their activities (including the projects they work on campaign meetings and events relationship of the campaign to the media and to constituency groups) the internal dynamics and work of the campaign the different roles and tasks of staff and volunteers in the campaigns the way the media reports on the campaign the students' reflections on these matters and at the end a summary of the campaign outcome. Students will be required to email the supervising Occidental faculty member at least once a week about their activities and reflections. The students will be supervised in the field by a campaign staff member. Students will participate through teleconferencing in a two-hour course meeting with other students and faculty three times during the semester. Students who will be working in different parts of the country will stay in touch with each other as well as with the faculty through Moodle a web-based course management system. The system allows faculty members to post readings facilitate discussions give and receive assignments etc. Students in various parts of the country will thus form a virtual classroom and on-line learning community. Some students may wish to document their experiences on the campaign trail observe events and interview staff and volunteers by making videos.

NOTE: Different topics may satisfy different Core Program requirements.\nClassical Quest for Justice\nThe questions at the heart of classical political philosophy are very simple, even if the treatments of them by the ancient philosophers are extremely complex. What is justice? What does it ask of us as individuals? What does it demand of political communities with respect to their internal structure and in their interactions with other communities, especially in times of war? Finally, to what extent are the demands of political life compatible with the radical questioning of philosophy? In this course we will engage with these questions via careful study of some of the greatest works of Ancient Greece, focusing principally on Plato\u2019s Republic and Thucydides\u2019 history of the Peloponnesian War. These texts will be approached not only as crucial documents for our understanding of another culture, but also as works that address enduring questions of moral and political life. Core Requirement Met: Pre-1800 (CPPE)\nSubfield: Political Theory\nMass Incarceration, Race, and Health Justice\nThis course analyzes the contemporary United States carceral system and social-structural pathways (e.g., poverty, housing, education, and policing) of mass incarceration through a health justice framework. As a legal framework aimed at addressing health disparities,\u00a0health justice elevates how racism, social control, bias, privilege, as well as the political and legal systems in which they are embedded, influence the social determinants of health.\u00a0The course will pay close attention to the evolving antiracist health equity movement and how structural discrimination, in particular racism, operates as a root cause of health inequities before, during, and post incarceration. The capstone project of the course follows a research-to-practice model, in which students will present upstream legal and policy interventions to address the racialized and health-harming nature of mass incarceration.\u00a0Core Requirement Met: United States\u00a0Diversity.\nComparing\u00a0Colonial\u00a0Legacies\nA comparative analysis of\u00a0colonial\u00a0governing practices, processes and modes of decolonization, and their long-term effects on the states and societies of the postcolonial world. Critical questions focused on in this course will include the relative political legacies of different types of\u00a0colonialism\u00a0(i.e. settler, exploitative, internal) and different\u00a0colonial\u00a0powers, the effects of\u00a0colonial\u00a0policies regarding ethnic boundary-making, and the implications of enduring ties of various kinds between the post-colonial\u00a0states and the former metropole. The geographical scope of this course will be broad, including, but not limited to, Latin America, the former Soviet Union, Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia. Core Requirement Met: Global Connections.\nPolitics of Development\nA comparative analysis of the politics and economics of states in the \u201cdeveloping world\u201d, including an introduction to theories that link variation in political systems to levels of economic development. This course will also analyze questions such as the relationship of natural\u00a0resource\u00a0dependency to political\u00a0regime characteristics, the determinants of foreign aid allocations, and the origins and roles of international development organizations. The geographical focus of the course includes Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, and the former Soviet Union. Core Requirement Met: Global Connections.\nPolitics of Immigration\nImmigration is one of the most hotly contested issues in American politics, and has been for some time. Much of the debate about how to craft immigration policies has come from politicians at the national level in the U.S. Congress, which has the responsibility to create policy, but important voices in the debate also come from state legislatures and community organizations. In this class, we will learn about the central issues regarding immigration that have emerged in both the body politic and in scholarly discourse. Topics addressed will include: why people migrate, why anti-immigrant sentiment is prevalent, the politics of immigration control policies, demographic trends, and notions of exclusion and inclusion. Our goal in the class is to come to a better understanding of the political process regarding immigration and why it matters. Core Requirement Met: United States\u00a0Diversity.",

The first two are friendly critics who seek to fortify liberalism against what they see as its latent pathologies, while Nietzsche is a not-so-friendly critic who wants to overturn it entirely. Given that liberalism is under attack today from both the right and the left, there is much to gain from serious study of their reflections. In this course, we will compare the strengths and weaknesses of their diagnoses of the present and visions for the future. Guiding questions for the course will include the following: Does liberal democracy uplift human beings, or degrade them? How should the competing demands of individual independence and community solidarity be balanced? How can we best counter modern society\u2019s tendency to engender stifling conformity? What is the significance of Christianity for the cultural heritage of Western society? What role, if any, should religion play in societies of the future? Finally, what does human flourishing consist of, and what kind of sociopolitical conditions best facilitate it?

In this course, we will examine the ways various Latin American social movements from the late nineteenth century to the present day have defined and practiced liberation, paying special attention to the distinctive role of religion in these movements. We will ask: How can religion provide a foundation for liberation? More specifically, how can religion foster visions of life honoring justice and prosperity? In what ways have religious communities lead organized resistances? And even when mobilizing for liberation, to what extent can religion continue to solidify forms of oppression? We will seek to answer these questions through a series of case studies including: 1) a unique form of \u201cmuscular\u201d evangelical Christianity across Latin America after the Spanish-American War (1898) that sought to combat the oppressive powers that limited their sovereignty; 2) liberation theology and spiritual praxis within the Mexican American Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s; and 3) Latino/a global missionary efforts through various evangelical organizations.

The final film of Andrei Tarkovsky was originally entitled\u00a0The Witch, and even the Ocean in his\u00a0Solaris\u00a0(based on Stanislav Lem\u2019s science fiction novel) is endowed with demonic features. The demonic\u2014at least in Eastern Europe\u2014is a mirror, in which a person could find their true self.\nWe will begin the semester by discussing the pagan beliefs and practices of the East Slavs that included a non-hierarchical and diverse pantheon of the so-called minor spirits that were more mischievous than evil, and frequently helped humans in their everyday tasks. We will then take a close look at several literary and cinematic works, in which the traces of this pagan worldview survive until our own times. These works might include novels, stories, and poems by Pushkin, Gogol, Lermontov, Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Chekhov, Tsvetaeva, Schulz, Lem, and films by Tarkovsky, Paradjanov, Sokurov, and Ilyenko.

Over the course of his lifetime, Du Bois wrote over 2000 bibliographical entries, across a range of genres, including: research monographs, plays, pamphlets, autobiography and biography, history, novels, poems, and popular press articles. At the same time, Du Bois utilized multiple methods, forms of data and evidence, and literary styles within and across texts. Nevertheless, in the domain of social science, and sociology more specifically, his work was intentionally marginalized. Yet while Du Bois was made a minor figure in American social science, he was a primary progenitor of the transdisciplinary field of Black, African American, or Africana studies and thus played a foundational role in circumventing the racial-colonial order of knowledge by attending to Black life and sociality. In this course, we will study the social theory of Du Bois by reading texts from across his vast corpus\u2014from his more formally social scientific writing and data visualizations to his creative projects like poetry and short stories.

What about using 3rd\u00a0parties like egg and sperm donors? Are reproductive technologies expanding definitions of family or reinforcing race, class, and gender inequalities? This upper-division seminar will examine reproduction from a social justice perspective, with particular attention\u00a0to\u00a0how the politics of reproduction are shaped by the intersecting inequalities of gender, race, class, dis/ability, and sexuality. Reproduction is not only a biological process; it is a battleground of social and political struggle. The course will familiarize students with foundational academic and activist approaches to reproduction. Students will learn about the history of and differences between reproductive rights and reproductive justice movements. We will then look at the new questions and challenges reproductive technologies raise for social justice. Cross Listed as UEP 395.\nPolicing, Power, and Violence\nIn this course, we will examine policing in the United States from the repression of Indigenous and enslaved peoples in the 18th century to the militarization of policing on the streets and the U.S.-Mexico border today. Using sociological understandings of power, we will analyze the judicial and extrajudicial violence that law enforcement agents engage in and how such violence serves to maintain the unjust and unequal social order. The course will close with us considering arguments for and against the abolition of police forces and prisons.\nSociology\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0Southern U.S.\nWhat, and where, is\u00a0the\u00a0South? Who is a southerner? What do they do down there, and why do they do what they do? Are\u00a0the\u00a0South\u00a0and southerners still distinctive?

The proposed course weaves urban planning, mapping and data research with qualitative analysis to recognize gentrification drivers, examine the pending experiential trauma of displacement and the community's aspirations and resistance. The course examines the communities of Northeast Los Angeles as they face three colossal planning projects that utilize gentrification as a catalyst and justification for their development.\nIn a holistic examination of the landscape, course participants will embed with community and other partners to explore the social networks and their relationship to research data. Course discussions will include developing metrics from an activist and documentary perspective to establish the observable community. Students will operate in small teams in developing data and fostering outcomes that reveal the human narrative.

The focus of the class will vary from year to year. May be repeated for credit one time with a different topic.\nLooking for August: A Critical Exploration into the Art, Life, and Legacy of August Wilson\nAfrican-American playwright August Wilson is perhaps the greatest American dramatist of the 20th Century.\u00a0 His unmatched \u201cCentury Cycle\u201d chronicles the African-American experience, and unearths deep-rooted dysfunctions of racism and socio-economic oppression, while at the same time celebrating the joy and resilience at the heart of African-American culture.\u00a0 Wilson was also an arts theorist, bringing to the fore front several explosive and controversial concepts concerning the American theater industry, particularly race-based vs. multicultural based casting.\u00a0 In this engaging course, we will explore Wilson\u2019s epic, ever evolving career.\u00a0 Course participants will collaboratively engage with some of his most iconic characters, in the attempt to re-discover what makes them so impactful and electrifying.\u00a0 We will discuss Wilson\u2019s life trajectory, his roots in Pittsburgh and griot approaches to playwriting, and peer deeply into some of his most iconic works, including Fences, A Piano Lesson, and the often misunderstood Joe Turner\u2019s Come and Gone. We will also examine Wilson\u2019s massive impact on 21st Century playwrights of all nationalities, and attempt to come to some comprehension of Wilson\u2019s almost limitless influence on theater and global culture.\u00a0\nThe Black Arts Movement Explored and Deconstructed\nAn in-depth, intellectually stimulating exploration into the complex and impactful Black Arts Movement of the 1960s and 1970s. Through reading and analyzing the poems, plays and criticism of the time, as well as lectures and small group discussions and \u201con your feet\u201d performance activities, students will gain insights into the people, the places, and the critical junctures that emerged during this profoundly explosive era of art and culture. Artists explored include Amiri Baraka, Sonia Sanchez, Nikki Giovanni, Henry Dumas, Audre Lorde, Ed Bullins, Ntozake Shange, and others. Themes/concepts include black identity, the connection between black arts and black power, the rejection of integration as an ideal, LGBTQ and Black Arts, the assassination of Malcolm X, John Coltrane and Sun Ra, black radical thought, the African-American male as a Christ figure, male chauvinism in Black Arts and Black Power, and \u201cfuture directions,\u201d i.e. the influence of the Black Arts Movement on other cultural movements and American aesthetics.",

During the course, students will help with The Highland Park Community Project\u2014Cornerstone\u2019s community engaged project in rehearsal and performance in Fall 2020. This production will provide the experiential aspects of the course, some of which will take place off-campus in the Highland Park Community. In regularly scheduled class meetings, students will study the Cornerstone methodology, especially intention and engagement, and through discussion, lectures, and research, be introduced to existing approaches to community based theater. Topics will include how community engagement informs acting, directing and design.\u00a0Additional\u00a0Core Requirement Met: U.S. Diversity.\nReframe the Game: Strategies for a More Inclusive American Theater\nReframe the Game is a deep dive into Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) principles, as they apply to working in the theater, as well as in interpersonal communication practices. Through hands-on activities, discussions, research and interactions with guest practitioners, the course will address why this work is vital to our field, and how EDI lays the foundation for more creative and imaginative artistic workspaces and practices. The course will be organized into three parts. Part One will focus on Vocabulary and Power Structures: The cohort will focus on establishing a shared vocabulary as a foundation for conversation about social identity, privilege, historical and institutional inequities, and ally-ship, as a means to develop skills to better identify and dismantle inequity when we see it. We will look inward to examine where we as individuals fit into the social landscape of America, and how our identities affect how we move through the world. Part Two will focus Research and Examination: Students will research EDI initiatives and strategies at US regional theaters as case studies to examine how stated EDI principles may (or may not) align with programming and institutional culture. In addition, local guest artists and practitioners whose work strongly aligns with social equity will visit the class for deep dive conversations about the work that they do, the challenges they face, and where they see the future of our field. Part Three will focus on Final Projects and the question What Now?: In small groups, students will apply what they have learned over the course of the semester to create an original exercise, workshop or governing policy that addresses a specific EDI concern in their community (institutional, local, national or international) to present to their classmates and invited faculty in the final weeks of the semester. Prerequisite: THEA 101, THEA 210, or by instructor permission. Additional\u00a0Core Requirement Met: U.S. Diversity.\nGenerating Independent Theater\nThis interdisciplinary course will provide an opportunity for students to define their interests as performers/writers/producers and to develop original material, an artistic vision, and producing expertise that will lead to a realized performance. Individual skill sets and interests including storytelling, dance, character-work, visual art and music may each provide a jumping off point for this work. At the beginning of the course, a series of improvisational exercises, mini-performances and character studies, supported by readings on contemporary solo, immersive, experimental and environmental theater, will guide students to land on personal solo or two-person projects. In the second half of the semester, students will craft these pieces utilizing their peers as a think-tank. This generative, collaborative process will emphasize the importance of ensemble both onstage and behind the scenes during the creative and production process. To culminate their work, the class will be responsible for the production aspects necessary to present their pieces in a public performance on-campus. Prerequisite:\u00a0THEA 210, THEA 330, THEA 380, or permission of instructor. \nAutobiographical Performance: Laughing At Ourselves\nIn this course,\u00a0participants will learn how to create compelling and humorous personal nonfiction narratives for the stage, studying\u00a0classic narrative structure and paying close attention to theme & detail.\u00a0There is a long history of performers whose autobiographical solo work, like Crabb\u2019s, simultaneously finds comedy in the tragedies of their lives while infusing the mundane with drama. To learn how to do this,\u00a0students will study seminal storytellers and theater makers, (such as Spalding Gray, John Leguizamo,\u00a0\u00a0Whoopi Goldberg, Julia Sweeney, and others)\u00a0who use their lives and experiences as templates for performance.\u00a0Students will also review Moth-style storytelling to help find their own voice through a close examination of identity, self, and how we perform in the world.",

Topics to be covered include food safety water access and equality pesticides air quality the identification of environmental hazards the assessment of various risks (including exposure to dangerous chemicals used in toys food workplaces and other activities) and the social and biological causes of disease (epidemiology) Students will gain an understanding of environmental health analytical and scientific methods. We will also explore ways that communities and policy-makers seek to address environmental health challenges.  A common thread running through the course will be an examination of how exposure to environmental and health risks vary among different population groups in the Los Angeles area in the United States and around the world and the ways that scientific issues become embedded in and inseparable from issues of policy regulation and justice.

North America had been dotted with great metropolises and minor towns for thousands of years, and new waves of European and African settlers founded hundreds of new ones as well. \u00a0Indeed, for many early migrants, America was itself a \"city on the hill\" -- an urban image for a new society. \u00a0In this course, we will survey American urban history from those early days to the present, focusing in the second half specifically on Los Angeles, where new forms of decentralized urbanism took form in the twentieth century. \u00a0We will explore not only suburbia and freeways, Disneyland and other quasi\u00adurban outposts, but also the changing character of the inner city in the mid\u00adtwentieth century, as well as radical efforts to reform existing American cities. \u00a0In the process, we encounter the American city of today -- multicentered, privately planned, decentralized, and multiethnic. \u00a0We will conclude by asking whether contemporary developments in urbanism -- the changing character of public space, the turn to privatism, and the neglect of public transport infrastructures, challenges to democracy and equality -- are ultimately compatible with the American dream of the \"city on the hill\" for the twenty\u00adfirst century.",

Throughout the course, students develop techniques for gathering and analyzing multimodal transcripts of naturally occurring conversations, interviews, discourses in institutional settings, media discourses, and texts of historical materials. The course draws from systemic functional linguistics, genre/text studies, multi-modal semiotics, interactional sociolinguistics, and critical social theory to understand how linguistic features of texts constitute, and are constituted by, the social, cultural, and local relations, processes, and contexts in which they are embedded. Using a seminar format, students will engage the readings and apply discourse analysis strategies in order to develop their own independent qualitative research projects.",

Current topics listed below:\nWriting and the Los Angeles Experience\nA combination writing workshop and community-based learning course, Writing and the Los Angeles Experience examines how Los Angeles shapes and is shaped by those who write about the city. Readings, class discussions, and writing assignments will engage the work of local writers whose work revolves around the city\u2014such as Paul Beatty, Francesca Lia Block, Luis Rodriguez, and Brando Skyhorse\u2014and the parts of Los Angeles that are central to their experience. Guest speakers and field trips to visit different areas of the city and attend live events will help us explore the way the city influences those who write about it, and the cultural, social, and political forces that make it tick. The work of this course is both critical and creative: students will write about our readings using conventional tools of academic writing and rhetoric, and respond to their own experiences of the city in reflections, stories, or other creative projects. Core Requirement Met: US Diversity and Fine Arts.\nProfessional Writing on Social Issues\nThis course encourages an engaged and dynamic approach to writing studies as it places writing in real-world contexts by partnering Oxy students with nonprofit community organizations in greater Los Angeles. Through these partnerships, students will identify local cultural and social concerns on topics such as homelessness/housing insecurity, poverty, immigration, education, and social activism, which represent the interests of our particular community groups. In this class we will explore a wide range of research and writing strategies common to both academic environments and the professional situations of our community partners, including primary or field research and both individual and collaborative writing projects in professional genres. This course will allow students to see community nonprofit organizations -- plus the cultural social and political issues and rhetoric surrounding them -- from the inside out. The work of this class is thus both scholarly and practical, motivating student learning by enlivening and enriching students' approaches to writing studies. Core Requirement Met: Global Connections.",

This class positions the study of feminist rhetorics within the larger study of language and discourse theories as we examine how social relations power knowledge and identities are constituted through private and public rhetorical acts. Through our readings we will engage a wide range of contributions to a rhetorical critical history by women who either as practitioners or theorists advanced their visions of social change and acted to implement them. Course readings will begin in antiquity to provide a foundation for our study though much of our material will focus on texts from the nineteenth-century to the present to examine the intersections of gender and rhetoric. Through this work we will challenge the seeming erasure of women from this critical history and interrogate the notion of \"feminist rhetoric\" as merely a corollary to a masculinist tradition. Assignments will include critical essays and a visual rhetoric project on representations of women in the media and popular culture.",
