This seminar explores the portable objects that were created within, and impacted by, the global mercantilismes and colonialism\u2019s of the Spanish and Portuguese empires. We will follow a series of moving items that defy the traditional categories of singular authors or cultures. Their travels span distant points in the colonial maritime world, such as Goa, Manila, Mexico City, Nagasaki, Antwerp, Lisbon, and Potosi. Each class will center around 1-2 select \u201cObjects in Focus.\u201d Ranging from the high-end to the everyday, these works will include ivories, feather mosaics, silver work, lacquer, ceramics, paintings, prints, textiles, and more. They will intersect with a series of discussions on appropriation, reuse, display intent, theft, copying, gifting, erasure, fashion, labor and race. The paths of things past offer a more nuanced view of our own current systems of globalized capitalism and its reflection in artistic production and display to this day."

It will consider how massive physical destruction necessitated the reconstruction of urban landscapes in Germany, France, England, Japan, and the United States. We will study urban redevelopment, in addition to architectural structures such as museums, memorials, and monuments, in order to discern how governments, societies, and individuals attempt to come to terms with the historical past. We will ask the following questions: What role do museums, memorials, and monuments play in the architectural landscape of a city? What design restrictions are posed by these types of institutions? How are abstract and representational forms employed in the memorialization process? Through an examination of these questions, students will gain an understanding of diverse built environments within an era marked by fundamental shifts in (post)modernism, technology, and aesthetics. To this end, emphasis will be placed on the ways in which memory and place are conceived within particular cultural and intellectual circumstances."

This course explores the arts of the Spanish Monarchy from the plurality of perspectives and voices that composed this global empire ruled by the Habsburg dynasty (1516-1700). This will mainly concentrate on the arts of painting and sculpture, two crucial cultural traditions of this period. We will explore what \u201cpainting\u201d and \u201csculpture\u201d meant in different parts of the Empire, and how it also could integrate a broad range of decorative materials like feathers, gold, shell and ivory. Themes like religious visions, portraits, and still life will all receive attention. Famous artists and objects like Velazquez\u2019 Las Meninas will come into conversation with the lesser-known and even anonymous makers of indigenous, creole and African descent, which all contributed to the history of sculpture and painting under the Spanish monarchy.

    "description": "The cities of Paris and Berlin formed a major axis of cultural production and exchange during the early- to mid-20th century. Both were modern political and industrial capitals, and both cities were vibrant catalysts for the work of cultural producers of all stripes - from artists, writers, filmmakers, musicians, and architects, to social theorists, scientists, psychologists, and political activists. Like magnets, these two cities drew people from across the European and American continents to their streets, offering the promise of cultural ferment and collective interaction, in cities each with their own traditions of avant-garde, modernist practice. But, people also moved between these two cities, creating networks and subcultures, sharing ideas and diverse cultural perspectives, in ways that radically transformed the cultural landscapes of 20th century Europe and America. As capitals, Paris and Berlin also offer views into the major social and political upheavals of the 20th century, culminating in the transformation of a networked, intercultural model of exchange between the two cities, in the 1920's and 1930's, into an actual occupation of Paris by Berlin in 1940. In this course, we will map out these varied structures of exchange by exploring the histories of the two cities through research and analysis of key urban sites, centers, and cultural producers who lived and worked there between 1910 and 1945.

The Baroque style that prevailed in the European empires during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries fostered an aesthetic of irregular forms, highly emotional and dramatic effects, and stark contrasts of light and dark. The troubled painter Caravaggio, the Mexican nun-poetess and mystic Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz, and the German Jesuit polymath Athananasius Kircher all encapsulate this crucial cultural moment. This course will examine the arts of the Baroque period from a global perspective: each week we will travel to different locations around the world to examine its shifting contours. From Mexico City to Rome, we will explore the different iterations of this distinctive style via painting, sculpture, architecture, poetry, fashion, music, optical instruments, and even stage design.

Using a wide range of photographs and photographic practices, the class will consider how photographs are instrumental in forming our notions of self, family, work, and nation. We will also grapple with the difference between analogue and digital photography and photography's relation to the physical world. The class will read key photography essays that will challenge students to think critically about the role of photography in contemporary culture and modernity, historiography, and science. We will use a broad range of art techniques like drawing, painting, printmaking, sculpture, digital alteration, and even craft techniques to remake and rework photographs to reveal hidden truths or create new meanings. Unlike some classes where you learn art techniques first, here you will be expected to adopt techniques and generate art from a set of ideas that arise from our readings, discussions, experiments, and field trips."

Students will improve their communication skills by discussing papers and leading discussions, by writing a research paper and peer-editing, and by preparing PowerPoint presentations as an aid for leading discussions. May be taken more than once for credit as the topics will differ each semester, but can only be used to fulfill one of the requirements for the Biology major. Cannot be used to fill the Biology requirement of the Biochemistry major."

You will be introduced to the continent through the perspectives of four critical African literary and political thinkers, each bringing a novel perspective to African political identity.

At the same time, however, their intellectual and political contributions and frameworks have often been ignored or co-opted by others. In this class, we will engage with the myriad ways in which Black women write for social justice, including creative writing, academic essays and talks, films and performances. Through exploring authors who write from various national/international/transnational positions and identities, we will locate African American history and literature within a larger Black diasporic history and literature to understand the global nature of Black women\u2019s writing. Topics will include, but are not limited to, violence against women, access to education, reproductive justice, the linkages between racism and capitalism, self-representation and alternative visions of the world. By taking seriously the contributions of Black women writers, we will also undertake the work of figuring out the definitions behind the words that make up our class title: how do our authors define Black? How do they define what it means to be women? What is the importance of writing? And finally, how do our authors conceptualize and define social justice?"

Many scholars have rejected the idea that the persistence of a number of racial ills \u2013 like racial inequality, racial discrimination and racial segregation \u2013 in the contemporary moment is evidence that racism also persists as a problem in the twenty-first century. \u201cRacism,\u201d these scholars argue, more accurately describes the Jim Crow South and the people in that era who consciously held explicit beliefs about white superiority over all other races. Though acknowledging changes in racial climate and the terrain of acceptable speech with regards to race, other scholars think that unequal racial outcomes, institutional practices and ideological beliefs connect our contemporary racial problems to racial problems that occurred in the 1960s and earlier. This course is an introduction to the scholarship on racism and has as a central aim to get us to judge together whether \u201cracism\u201d is the appropriate concept to describe and provide a frame through which to understand our contemporary problems concerning race. If it is, which accounts of racism are the most compelling to shed light on our current racial circumstances? What about these accounts are particularly pertinent? What can\u2019t the accounts of racism addressed in class explain? If racism is not the right concept to capture our current struggles with race (or all aspects of it), what concepts if any do a better job and why? To facilitate a critical interrogation of the concept racism, this course will cover sociological, historical, social psychological, philosophical and political accounts of racism and related concepts like racial injustice, racial prejudice, race relations, and racial inequality."

    "description": "W.E.B. (William Edward Burghardt) Du Bois, was a prolific scholar, writer, and social/political analyst and organizer. Over the course of his lifetime, Du Bois wrote over 2000 bibliographical entries, across a range of genres, including: research monographs, plays, pamphlets, autobiography and biography, history, novels, poems, and popular press articles. At the same time, Du Bois utilized multiple methods, forms of data and evidence, and literary styles within and across texts. Nevertheless, in the domain of social science, and sociology more specifically, his work was intentionally marginalized. Yet while Du Bois was made a minor figure in American social science, he was a primary progenitor of the transdisciplinary field of Black, African American, or Africana studies and thus played a foundational role in circumventing the racial-colonial order of knowledge by attending to Black life and sociality. In this course, we will study the social theory of Du Bois by reading texts from across his vast corpus\u2014from his more formally social scientific writing and data visualizations to his creative projects like poetry and short stories. For the final project of the course, students will deploy a Du Boisian approach to social theory and analysis using more expressive forms (such as illustration, painting, film and video, poetry, music, photography, data visualization, short stories, or lyrical essays)."

We will analyze these ever-shifting racialized standards of beauty in relation to American demographic, economic, and political developments, such as the rise of Jim Crow, the emergence of the New Woman, and the black power movement.

At times, working class women and women of color have also been demonized as carriers of contagion or even romanticized as repositories of traditional wisdom. Furthermore, women\u2019s roles in community health have been heavily shaped by gendered and racial constructions of the body, disease, and wellbeing.\u00a0 Thus, while the focus of the course is on the social history of women\u2019s health and healing, the theoretical framework of the course also aims to explore how ideologies of gender, race, class, and sexuality shape women\u2019s relationship to community health as both caregivers and health-seekers. The course is organized by a set of common themes that cut across time, space, and racial/ethnic boundaries in U.S. History.\u00a0 Themes include: spirituality and healing; work and health; sexuality and reproduction; activism for health justice.\u00a0 An important goal of this course is to make connections between historical studies of women and health and present-day community health activism. Much of the course and especially the community partnership component focuses on the leadership of women of color in shaping agendas for community well-being.\u00a0 In the past, course participants have worked with the organizations Black Women for Wellness, California Latinas for Reproductive Justice, Visi\u00f3n y Compromiso, and Promesa Boyle Heights. We will continue to work this year with women\u2019s health organizations and the Southern California Library on a Reproductive Justice community partnership. In addition, we will welcome several community health activists & scholars to the class as guest speakers."

We will engage with cultural producers from the Black diaspora (including, but not limited to: the United States, the Caribbean and the United Kingdom) working within critical ethnic studies, literary analysis, queer of color critique and performance studies, among others, and take seriously what they share in regards to prison abolition, the linkages between racism and capitalism, Black trans activism and other critical issues that demand our attention and action. We will locate these intersectional conversations within Black diasporic contexts \u2013 the literary, theoretical, political and cultural \u2013 as we seek potential answers to the questions posed above. Students will be asked to complete a research paper at the end of the term."

Through historical and contemporary case studies, discussion, and engagement with a range of thinkers, including, but not limited to, Saidiya Hartman, Lucy Parsons, Zo\u00e9 Samudzi, William C. Anderson, Lorenzo Kom\u2019boa Ervin, and Fred Moten, students will explore how anarchism (broadly defined) is a critical resource for Black life."

In particular we will explore how Revolutions in British North America France and Haiti influenced the movement to end the slave trade and slavery in the Americas and galvanized slave revolts and other movements for Black liberation and human rights around the Atlantic World. A variety of readings including autobiography social and political history and ethnography will illuminate not only the history of the Atlantic World but new forms of scholarly writing that break the mold of national historical narratives. Themes include: slavery slave revolt the discourse of human rights resistance religion labor and shifting ideologies of difference in particular gender class and race."

What does it mean to be careless with language, to not use it, to be indifferent to it and rob it of its esteem? What does it mean to kill or stifle language by official decree? In our seminar on Toni Morrison, we will engage with the writings of one of the most preeminent writers and critical thinkers in literature (US-based and otherwise) in order to examine the powerful and provocative ways in which she asked and answered these questions before her passing on 05 August, 2019. We will situate her as a cultural critic, one who produced novels, short stories, essays and speeches and in doing so, informed the frameworks of American Literature, Black Feminist Theory, American Studies and Critical Race Studies, among other fields. Thus, we will collectively unpack the ways in which Morrison\u2019s writings have guided, contested and informed American cultural and literary production in the 20th and 21st centuries.\u00a0Students will be asked to complete a research paper at the end of the term.\u00a0"

    "description": "This course thinks through current debates over the relationship between literary aesthetics and harmony in American democracy. Do aesthetics foster a more harmonious or disharmonious national culture? Is disharmony ever important to progress? How does literature represent protests for social change that are often only possible outside the law, like the many freedmen and freedwomen escaping slavery and demanding the destruction of that system? How does this alter our understandings of what it means to be a fugitive? How can the fugitive fighting for freedom be distinguished from the unprincipled outlaw? From another perspective, we will consider how the complications of American society have altered certain traditional literary forms. While recent scholarship has addressed these questions in regards to early- to mid-20th century literature, this course will look back further, starting from the early 19th century to the very beginning of the 20th. We will complement the literature by reading relevant historical materials from the abolitionist movement, labor movements, government debates over Emancipation and Reconstruction, etc. The course will include literature from Frederick Douglass, Sojourner Truth, Walt Whitman, Ida B Wells, and Charles Chesnutt, amongst others, and will cover several genres, including: oratory, autobiography, political pamphlets, and short fiction."

Students will engage the prison industrial complex, abandonment & deindustrialization, policing, geographic containment, the consumption of blackness as popular culture, formations of neoliberalism, and antiblack state and state-sanctioned terror as contemporary formations of chattel slavery\u2019s afterlives.

The first part of the course will examine several industrial processes that have been using enzymes for decades to produce the final commercial product. Emphasis will be placed on the technical challenges required for large-scale production of the compound. Course content will then shift to the academic arena, exploring current processes that the chemical industry wishes to replace with biologically-based systems. The challenges associated with scaling-up these processes will be emphasized, drawing on the foundation laid in the first part of the course. Finally, based on these lectures, students will be asked to take a \"dirty\" chemical process and propose a \"green\" solution, and identify the technical challenges that must be surmounted.

Yet technology is not created in a vacuum, but rather is a product of the ingrained assumptions of its creators, and the societies that structure these assumptions. When working with the tools of Computer Science, students will face traces of the field\u2019s racist, sexist, homophobic, and imperialist history, and will have to decide how to work with or challenge these parts of the field.\u00a0This course prepares students to work for justice and equity in technology and society by facilitating conversations about the sometimes-oppressive history and impact of Computer Science, and by uplifting voices that have historically been marginalized within the field. By the end of the course, students will be able to analyze and discuss technology within its broader context, and be able to use the tools of Computer Science to subvert the unjust structures the field has inherited."

We often think of touch as doing things with our hands, but touch actually affects all parts of the body, and plays a role in smell (particles entering the nose), sound (as vibration or a wave), taste (of the tongue touching), and even vision (through synesthesia or haptic visuality). However, in the current age of social distancing, many of us are feeling \u201ctouch starved,\u201d and looking to digital media as a source of intimacy and community. How can we learn in this moment from haptic technologies, haptic aesthetics, and uses of these in video games, virtual reality, digital-physical art installations, and even early moving pictures? How can we communicate felt experiences as forms of unique knowledge? Drawing from video game studies, humor and gimmicks, feminist film theory, and Black feminist thought, this course takes an interdisciplinary approach to questions of haptic media.

In particular, we will examine how time provides a crucial framework for how we imagine the future. We will take the seemingly self-evident concept of time and critically examine its intellectual history to consider how time serves a crucial function as a means of ordering our cultural, economic, and political ideas as well as our individual lives. Frameworks of history, modernity, and futurity rely on concepts of development and progress that are related to broader ideas of race and sexuality. In what ways do historical representations of time, development, and progress structure how we imagine the future? On whose behalf is progress being imagined? Where is progress located? What are the ideals of the future? Whose pasts are connected to the futures that we privilege? In considering these questions, we will examine a range of novels, films, empirical studies, and cultural theory that provide a complex portrait of how the future is imagined, especially from the perspective of those scripted out of its dominant narrative. We will engage with critical and literary approaches including Afrofuturism, queer futurity, the developmental novel, economic models, and science fiction."

    "description": "A basic understanding of Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud is a prerequisite for participating in critical debates in the humanities and social sciences. In this course we will read some of the central texts in which these thinkers developed their revolutionary models of analysis: historical materialism, post-metaphysical philosophy, and psychoanalysis. Though very different, what all three of these thinkers had in common was a rejection of the rational subject and with it the notion that commonplace social norms involved in knowledge, morality, and sexuality represented timeless and universal truths determined by a neutral subjectivity. Instead, each sought to explain how these norms were in fact social constructions that are best explained by analyzing the specific historical and sociological conditions in which they arose. For Marx, this project involved an analysis of how power and class relations contribute to the production of \u201cideology\u201d, for Nietzsche an investigation into the history and transformation of morality, and Freud the exploration of the unconscious. The result is a radical transformation of our understanding of subjectivity and a realization of the deeply contingent and malleable nature of human existence. We will investigate these theories by examining works of Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud within their contemporaneous contexts, drawing on the literature, art, and music of the time as well as more recent history and film as points of elucidation and comparison."

Questions to be discussed in the course include: what can small mean at the level of (literary) form? What kind of readings does small form facilitate? Which does it thwart? To what extent does small form gain epistemological significance with respect to the critique of systematic philosophy? And what can its contemporary manifestation in the form of social media \u201cmicroformats,\u201d such as tweets, blog posts, and Vine videos, inform us about condensation, narration, and knowledge in the present?

    "description": "What is despair and what does it tell us about being human that we alone can seemingly experience it? Is it equivalent to sadness or depression? Can it be relieved by material wealth, fame, success? For Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard despair was not a passing temporal condition but something that in itself points beyond itself to the possibility of its own overcoming. In doing so, despair, for Kierkegaard, forces open the crucial existential question: What does it mean to be a self? This course will examine this question by exploring changing conceptions of selfhood and despair from antiquity to modernity, moving from Achilleus\u2019 despairing rage in the Iliad to Dostoyevsky\u2019s depiction of the individual revolting against society in the Notes from the Underground and culminating in the seemingly irredeemable despair of Cormack McCarthy. Readings will include works by Homer, Plato, Thucydides, the Stoics, Marguerite of Porete, Meister Eckhart, Martin Luther, Soren Kierkegaard, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Leo Tolstoy, Franz Kafka, Cormack McCarthy, and Flannery O\u2019Connor."

    "description": "This course will investigate the concept of madness as both a social category and\u00a0one of the crucial terms of art and literature.\u00a0 On the one hand, madness often carries with it a negative connotation, as a statement or mental state beyond the realm of sense. Yet on the other, aesthetic theory has long considered madness\u00a0a necessary condition of great art. For the philosopher Immanuel Kant, the art of the genius must break the rules of style and\u00a0explode the bounds of the ordinary sense in order to be exceptional. Art, in this sense must necessarily push the boundaries of the normal, straddle the realms of\u00a0madness and sanity and, in doing so, transform the categories we use to understand the world. Thus, by seeing madness not as some eternal category, but as constructed and deconstructed in concrete contexts,\u00a0the dialectic of madness and genius forces upon us\u00a0the following questions: How does the concept of madness get constructed? Who gets to decide who is and isn't mad and why? Why is the creation of art so tightly bound up with concept of madness? What does this tell us about how we make sense of the world and the possibilities of changing our own forms of understanding? We will investigate these questions by reading works of literature and philosophy that directly and indirectly address issues of madness and its relationship to creativity. \u00a0Readings\u00a0will include works by Michel Foucault, Franz Kafka, Heinrich von Kleist, Honore de Balzac, Virginia Woolf,\u00a0Deleuze & Guattari, Goethe,\u00a0Adalbert Stifter, Immanuel Kant,\u00a0and Ralf Waldo Emerson."

    "description": "Statesman, scientist, philosopher, poet, and in the words of Friedrich Nietzsche, \u201cthe last German before whom I felt reverence\u201d, this course will examine the life and work of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Widely regarded as the Shakespeare of German literature, Goethe\u2019s status as the major influence on the course of not only 19th century German but European literature was long simply assumed. Yet for a figure of this stature Goethe seems to embody a contradiction. No one quite knows what he stands for. Is Goethe the young Romantic of his youth; the aristocrat and politician of his middle period and founder of the coming of age novel, in which, as Hegel put it, \u201cthe hero loses his horns\u201d; or is he the mad scientist of his later works which he canonically etches into literary history in form of Faust? We will investigate these transformations and contradictions by asking how Goethe\u2019s almost obsessive quest for unity and form can be reconciled with the turmoil, change and disruption so emblematic of his life and work. We will do so by reading the canonical novels and dramas from his early, middle, and late periods, while also spending time with his scientific writings and the most beautiful poetry the German language has to offer. In short, we will examine Goethe not just as an author, but as a practitioner of the art of living. What does It mean to be young, mature, grow old and die? To fashion a self out of the turbulence and change that dominated not only Goethe\u2019s age, but our times as well? We will seek guidance in these questions by examining the interrelationships between Goethe\u2019s life, work and the age that came to be known as the Goethezeit.

    "description": "This course will be centered around an in-depth investigation of one of the most controversial and influential philosophers of the 20th Century, Martin Heidegger. Rejecting what he saw as the tradition of western metaphysics and its quest for absolute knowledge, Heidegger's phenomenological\u00a0approach focused on an analysis of lived experience\u00a0and the structures that make that experience possible. Fundamental to this analysis are the ideas of finitude and fallibility. Human beings, for Heidegger, are never closed and completed, secure in their knowledge and understanding of themselves, but beings who are fundamentally concerned with their own being, who seek to determine themselves from within the complex social, historical, and interpersonal contexts into which they were thrown. As such, philosophy, for Heidegger, becomes interpretation, the attempt to interpret and reinterpret oneself and one's place within a changing and complex world, always with the possibility of failure. The course will investigate this project of \"existential hermeneutics\" through an in-depth investigation of some of Heidegger's major writings. The first half of the course will focus on a close reading of the first half of\u00a0Being and Time\u00a0while in the second half we will look at Heidegger's post war essays, his turn to \"poetic thinking\" and the legacy of Heidegger's thought on 20th century Continental philosophy.

But what was the Enlightenment?\u00a0This course will investigate the Enlightenment in all its complexities and contradictions. As an era defined by radical critique, Enlightenment thinkers rejected the authority of religion, tradition, and aristocracy, and sought to transform our understanding of nature, culture, and history by grounding these fields\u00a0on the transparent rational principles of freedom, progress, and universality. In doing this, the Enlightenment embroiled itself and us in a contradiction. It\u00a0both created the fundamental terms, ideals, and institutions\u00a0that frame our contemporary understanding of the world\u00a0while also establishing a discourse of universality and eurocentrism that serves as the object of our greatest critique. Yet far from being one thing, the Enlightenment also possessed the tools for its own self critique. Or, in the words of Johann Gottfried Herder, \"What is universal reason but a cover for our favorite, whims, idolatry, blindness and laziness?\" Following, Herder, Rousseau, and Goethe, this course will also investigate the alternative conceptions of nature, culture, and history that rejected the universalist and imperialist strand of Enlightenment thinking in favor of a dynamic, process-oriented understanding of history and nature as\u00a0eternally unfolding. With this conception, the Enlightenment perhaps offers\u00a0an alternative to help us in our quest to think beyond it.

They came into adulthood to realize that their parent\u2019s generation were if not perpetrators then\u00a0at least accomplices to one of the gravest genocides in human history, that they had enthusiastically endorsed a fascistic maniac, that the\u00a0country they inhabited\u00a0stood in ruins, bombed to the ground morally and physically, and that they now stood at the epicenter\u00a0of the cold war, half capitalist, half communist. From the perspective of the 68ers, the worst of all was that there had been no cultural\u00a0reckoning. With the conclusion of the Nuremberg trials and the prosecution of the elite Nazi administration, the majority of the population seemed content to simply to forget. For the 68ers that was not an option. Rather than view the WWII and the Holocaust as an aberration and horrific exception to German culture, the youth of the 68er generation demanded a revolutionary reevaluation of everything German. They asked: What factors, economic, social, cultural, and historical, led to this catastrophe? How can we come to terms with this past? And what vision of a transformed future could replace the old? The answer to these questions involved a three-step approach. A radical critique of the past and the structures of nationalism, patriarchy, heteronormativity, racism, and capitalism, which they believed were the foundational underpinnings of German fascism. Active political dissent that demanded change and culminated in the domestic bombings of the left-wing group the Red Army Faction. And a total re-conception of the norms of society, sexuality, and selfhood perhaps best represented in the Love Parade and the drugs, sex, and radical experimentation that fueled the raves and Berlin techno scene after the fall of the Berlin Wall."

This course examines all aspects of this culture as it developed in the years 800-1600, in order to understand how these people viewed the world, and how this affected their lives and the development of Slavic culture. Communal village life, legends, folk genres and mythology, their sources, and their legacies, are examined. There is a close study of the phenomenon of the vampire, following its evolution from the Iron Age into 18th century Serbia, as a specific case study of how myths are born and persist. The ways in which pagan beliefs were incorporated into Christianity to create the \"dual-faith\" of the Russian peasant are examined, as well. In addition to analytical and historical texts, readings include tales of supernatural beings and phenomena, as well as testimony concerning encounters with the supernatural."

The primary object of this course will be to survey some of the more impressive and surprising ways in which literature, art, and philosophy have engaged with, and contributed to, the prismatic strangeness of this myth of Prometheus--from the ancient songs of Hesiod and Aeschylus, to the Romantic soundings of Goethe, Shelley and Herman Melville\u2019s Moby Dick; from its intellectual appropriation by Marx, Nietzsche, Heidegger and Freud, to its \u201cplastic\u201d rendering in the murals of Orozco, the statuary of Paul Manship, and the contemporary films of Ridley Scott and Alex Garland (director of Ex Machina). More tentatively, the larger goal of the class will be to consider whether the Prometheus myth in its entirety might not be guided by the reflection that absolute assertions of authority and power always imply their own undoing, and that sovereignty will forever be linked to suffering and to sorrow."

To this end, we shall make ourselves familiar with some of the most important thinkers in recent literary and cultural theory (Foucault, Derrida, Kristeva, Sianne, and Ngai, to name but a few). Given the course\u2019s broad international range, guest lecturers will be brought in throughout the semester to discuss the effect of reading works in the original language and to explore, more generally, the effect that the specific features of a language can exert over that delicate interplay of \u201cliterature, culture, and self\u201d that forms the central subject matter of this class.

What, for instance, do narrative forms --from Babylonian epic to the experimental prose of David Foster Wallace and Karl Ove Knausgaard--tell us about the kinds of worlds that are ours to inhabit in our daily lives? How do the poetic forms of (say) the ballad, the haiku, the sonnet or pop song inflect the manner in which we every day take up our existence? How does drama--from Ancient Greek tragedy to Japanese noh to the theatres of the avant-garde, the cruel and the absurd--open up for us the experience of all those \"others\" with whom we share this life?

Starting with the writings of Johann Caspar Lavater, whose monumental \"Physiognomic Fragments\" (1775-78) advocated physiognomy as a means of \"promoting human understanding and human love,\" this course will explore the widespread influence that the art of interpreting physical features had in the intellectual and artistic milieu of the 18th century, and, arguably, continues to exert in the modern day. We will examine physiognomy in the aesthetic, cultural, literary, and scientific contexts of the German Enlightenment, dealing with major figures such as Goethe, Lessing, Lichtenberg, Schiller, and Hegel, as well as the unprecedented boom in popularity of physiognomy\u00a0around 1900, when it was embraced by many prominent strands of German thought, from the \"philosophy of life\" (Nietzsche, Spengler, Kassner) and literary modernism (Rilke, Benn, Musil), to eugenics, criminology, and racial biology.

We will also interrogate the different ways in which writing has been theorized in modernity: as a self-referential symbolic practice; as a form of communication in which memory, experience and knowledge are produced, articulated and organized; and as a procedure of inscription in which language, technology, and bodily gesture are inextricably intertwined.

The literature and films about the Baader-Meinhof Gang, which illustrate the crushing effect of National Socialism on the generation of '68, as well as their rebellion against the excesses of the capitalist consumer paradise, are controversial. Many have condemned the movies for their exciting, Bonnie-and-Clyde depiction of the gang members that gives the group\u2019s leaders their cult status.

Furthermore, Bakhtin's approach to the text reveals prose fiction, and, to some degree, non\u00adfiction, as a unique medium through which language explores human consciousness in both time and space. In this course, Bakhtin's theories are studied in order to understand more deeply the significance of the novel, and novels are studied in order to better understand Bakhtin's theories. Works as diverse as Fyodor Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment, Venedikt Yerofeev's Moscow to the End of the Line, Umberto Eco's Foucault\u2019s Pendulum, and Manuel Puig's Kiss of the Spider Woman, are examined through the Bakhtinian lens in order to broaden the students' understanding of the text as a polyphonic phenomenon.

Findings from the science of memory are brought to bear upon Roman strategies for remembering, for commemorating, and for purposely forgetting. Theories of culture drawn from evolutionary anthropology, developmental psychology, and philosophy of biology are adduced to cast new light on our evidence for Roman forms of participatory rather than instructional pedagogy, in-group / out-group formation,\u00a0prosocial and altruistic behavior, and mechanisms of cultural change.

Epicurus, for example, wrote, \u201cThere is no use in philosophy, unless it casts out the suffering of the soul.\u201d In this course, we examine the therapeutic programs offered by various ancient philosophical schools: the Peripatetics (followers of Aristotle), Stoics (followers of Zeno of Citium), Epicureans (followers of Epicurus), Skeptics (two schools, one descending from Plato\u2019s Academy and the other from Pyrrho), and finally the Christian philosophy of Augustine of Hippo, which was informed by but also broke decisively with the Greco-Roman philosophical tradition that had preceded it. In order to understand the therapeutic programs of these schools, we shall first have to understand each school\u2019s account of human nature (\u201canthropology,\u201d in its original sense), of the mind or soul (\u201cpsychology,\u201d in its original sense), and of the purpose or \u201cend\u201d of human existence (\u201cethics\u201d). Each school\u2019s answer to the question of why we suffer and how we might find psychological peace\u00a0only makes sense in light of that school\u2019s beliefs about what it is to be human, what is the nature of the mind/soul, and what is the purpose of life. Our source materials in this investigation will include classic texts in ancient ethical thought: Cicero\u2019s Tusculan Disputations, a literary masterpiece cast as a dialogue among prominent Romans who had sought refuge in the countryside as the end of the Roman republic unfolded; Seneca\u2019s On tranquility of mind, which takes the form of a letter to his friend Serenus, who had sought him out to find relief from his distress; and the third book of Augustine\u2019s Confessions, which details the author\u2019s suffering under the afflictions of lust and the apparent paradox of his perverse delight in his own misery."

The three units together will ask how sexual impulses disrupt a given socio-political order.\u00a0Students will evaluate the solutions to disruption offered by psychology (compromise), the court (crime and punishment according to a given society's laws), and religion (confessing sex acts to a religious official who will condemn them, impose penance, and absolve the transgressor).\u00a0"

Significantly, all three of these philosophers habitually turned to ancient Greek tragedy in the formulation, articulation, and further elaboration of their thought. In this class, we shall therefore attempt to use the experience of Greek tragedy, in all its ecstatic strangeness, as a powerful point of entry into the difficult yet crucial works these philosophers have bequeathed to us. Major texts to be covered include: the plays of Aeschylus and Sophocles, The Phenomenology of Spirit, The Birth of Tragedy, Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Being and Time, and Introduction to Metaphysics."

Our task in this course will be to try to understand why this vast array of literary types came to matter so much to the Greek-speaking empires of long ago, and why they still seem to matter so much to us today."

In this class, we shall attempt to answer the question of why style matters so deeply to us by relating the history of stylistic preferences (from ancient to modern times) to the history of metaphysics, to the question of Being itself. In other words, this course will test the thesis that our preferences for electric guitar over acoustic, for oil paint over water color, for free verse over iambic pentameter, have less to do with this or that particular thing within the world than they do with the way we answer the question of how or why there is a world for us, at all."

    "description": "There has been no shortage of disciplines and institutions that have sought to convince us that we interact with our world primarily through our minds. But one form of literature, at least, has always known otherwise. For no matter what philosophy, religion, ethics, or the law try to tell us, comedy will never let us forget that we exist, in this world at least, in and through our bodies. The bodies of comedy, however, unlike the bodies of science, art, or athletics, are neither orderly, nor inspiring, nor ideal. The comedic body is unruly, excessive, needy, offensive\u2014in a word, impolite. What is special about comedy, however, as this class will endeavor to show, is that it encourages us not to despair over our shared condition of gross embodiment, but rather to unite ourselves around it. Comedy creates community from the shared experience of our bodies\u2014 from our corpulent, crapulent, concupiscent corporeality. Having no interest in the maintenance of an ideal \"body politic,\" comedy rejoices in the humble togetherness of a \"body impolitic.\" Though this course will aim to establish a history of comedy from the ancient Greeks and Romans to the Medieval, Renaissance, and Restoration eras (and beyond), it will also make constant reference to modern comedic phenomena; the sit-com, the rom-com, the stand-up, the parody, and the roast\u2014to name but a few.\u00a0"

Traditionally, of course, the myth of Ulysses has been understood as a rather sentimental myth of nostos, or \"homecoming\": the hero, forced by fate into hateful foreign places, finally wins his way back to the security, stability, and contented self-sufficiency of his own native land. Or so the story goes. In this course, however, we will test the thesis that something more like the opposite of this interpretation may hold true. It may be, in other words, that the wanderings of the Ulysses figure (whether through the seas of the Mediterranean, the streets of Dublin, or the isles of the West Indies) work not so much to affirm the self\u00ad-sufficiency and comfort of home, as to trouble and destabilize it. What the heroes of these works might finally come to understand - and may even rejoice in - is not the idea that there is \"no place like home,\" but rather that, in the end, it is only within a certain placelessness that we are ever really \"at home\" at all."

By the 4th century BCE, Plato seems to have concluded that philosophy must eschew any interest in the flesh, inasmuch as flesh (whatever it may be) cannot yield to precise, philosophical investigation. Perhaps even more crucially, Plato stipulated that flesh cannot and should not be the basis of a politics, as it is only philosophical insight, in its disciplined refusal of the lure of the flesh, that could serve as the ground of genuine political communion. From here it was but a short step to conclude that poetry (and of course, \"art in general\"), entangled as it was with the body, could have little meaning or import for the practice of either politics or philosophy."

This course will examine various representations of the modern metropolis through film, literature, and cultural theory. The city, as we experience it today, is the product of multiple historical, cultural, and social forces. Over the course of the semester, we will consider how cities have been shaped by these forces, as well as how they, in turn, shape our own experience and understanding of culture, history, and social practices. In an era of increasing globalization and mobility, the role of the metropolis continues to evolve and expand. As we consider representations of the city in a variety of films and novels from around the world, including some from our own city of Los Angeles, we will interrogate the ways in which the city has played a formative role in how we imagine life in the contemporary moment. In what ways has the city become a vehicle for the production of culture? How does life in the city serve to normativize certain notions of what it means to live in the modern world? How does life in rural spaces complicate representations of modernity that take the city as their norm? Does the city promote accessibility, or, alternatively, does it rigidify codes of exclusivity? These are some of the many questions we will address as we consume a spectrum of world cinema and literature. As we work our way through the material, we will strive to develop a complex understanding of how cities shape our cultural imagination."

    "description": "This course will examine the relationship between resistance movements and the law through several historical and contemporary United States and Latin American case studies. We will begin the semester by exploring theoretical representations of resistance movements within critical legal theory and social movement theory. We will look at different conceptualizations of power and consciousness in our analysis of resistance, and the role of each in instigating resistance movements. We will then turn to an analysis of the law as a tool of collective struggle by studying and comparing the implicated rights and site-specific needs, objectives, strategies, and outcomes of each case study. We will look at the different ways these resistance movements may use the law to mobilize followers, to frame and address collective grievance, to advance and develop legal protections for marginalized groups, and to connect their localized struggles with global ones by redefining and reimagining concepts of dignity and freedom. Each case study will also provide us with an opportunity to explore the relationship between the law, state-sponsored violence, and repression of resistance movements. We will also examine the role and influence of legal advocacy organizations in contemporary resistance movements, and evaluate the current limitations of the law in contributing to social change. How do rights-based claims (e.g. indigenous rights, water rights) obscure the relationship between law and power, injustice, and structures of oppression? Can the law be a useful catalyst for change, and/or is it necessarily a supplement to grassroots organizing and mobilizing efforts? To examine these concepts and tensions, we will look at legislation and legal practices, landmark court cases, and critical scholarship related to our case studies. Among the resistance movements we will likely study are: Brazil's Landless Rural Workers Movement; indigenous resistance movements in North and South America, including resistance to the Dakota Access Pipeline and the Agua Zarca Hydroelectric Dam in Honduras; and different phases in the movement for black civil rights in the United States."

    "description": "Against the backdrop of 840 million persons worldwide suffering from malnourishment, and nearly 1.3 billion people living on less than a dollar per day, this course surveys the fields of international development, wealth creation, and global welfare, from a historical, global, and comparative perspective. The course will introduce students to the field's academic contours, building from the historic role of economics in pioneering and undergirding the field, to a broad understanding of the now interdisciplinary field that has emerged. The multi-disciplinary and interdisciplinary perspective of this introductory survey course is in keeping with an emerging global consensus that measures of poverty go beyond income and consumption, and that poverty reduction requires bridging disciplines (Economics, Political Science, History, Anthropology, Geography) and methods (quantitative and qualitative, observational and participatory). The course will be divided into two parts. During the first part of the course, students will be introduced to the main theoretical ideas on social, economic, and political development that have informed the field's evolution. This will familiarize students with fundamental thinking on development, as well as the frontiers of research. The second part of the course will explore some of the current debates about development. Students will analyze such debates in a rigorously multi-dimensional and interdisciplinary manner."

The first section of the course looks at the rise of dependency theory and import substitution industrialization (ISI) as the region's predominant development strategy. We will study the motivations behind ISI, its initial success in terms of economic growth, and the challenges associated with such strategies of development. We will focus on the origins of the 1980's debt crisis, the abolishing of the ISI model, and the subsequent turn to neoliberal development strategies. The course aims to provide students with a deeper understanding of the transition to neoliberalism, the so-called Washington Consensus, and the broader political and economic implications of the reform processes that have unfolded since the early 1980's. We will study the interaction between democratization and economic reform and aim to understand how these simultaneous transitions have affected the policy-making process and the formation of public policy in the region. Latin America is a diverse region; therefore, this course will emphasize its economic and political diversity."

We will investigate some of the following questions produced by the clash between global capitalism and local politics: How do authoritarian leaders react to the challenges of globalization in the 21st century? Does globalization undermine or enhance their hold on power? Will authoritarianism or democracy survive a long-term engagement with global markets?"

Then, we turn to the literature published after 2000 and consider how this literature has revised and built on ideas from the classics. We conclude with an overall assessment of knowledge about democratization and the endurance of democracy. In all, we will discuss explanations that put an emphasis on the economy and culture, as well as on politics itself. Much of what we will read reflects the focus of this literature on Europe, Latin America, and post-Soviet Eurasia.

Even though liberal democracy is winning favor the structural basis of inequality remains with increasing unemployment, poor education, weak health services, inadequate housing, soaring food and utility prices, and increasing levels of poverty. Opposition movements demand changes ranging from subsidized basic foodstuff to free education.

Our goal is to gain understanding of why European states have taken different political paths (including countries in Eastern Europe, the Nordic\u00a0states, and Turkey), while also exploring the context of regional integration in which European states are embedded. The European Union (formerly the European Community) and its 28-member states are thus also central to this subject, as it encapsulates the development of key political institutions, civil society, representation, and economics on the continent. We will thus explore what has been accomplished by European integration (e.g., maintaining peace, increasing mobility, granting human rights, enhancing multilateralism, and strengthening democracy), as well as the considerable challenges that lie ahead (e.g., \"Brexit\", eastern enlargement, the stability of the Euro, the integration of refugees, and the rise of populist parties). In sum, the course is designed to introduce students to central topics in both past and contemporary Europe politics through the lens of political science and theories of regional integration. Situated at the intersection of comparative and international politics, these theories will help us to understand the complex interactions between national governments,\u00a0supranational institutions,\u00a0and the everyday lives of European citizens that define Europe today."

In view of the remarkable infrequency of revolutions, Nikki Keddie - the eminent scholar of modern Iran - has devoted years of research in striving to answer the question: \"why has Iran been revolutionary?\" She reiterates that Iran has seen more modern revolutions than any country in the Muslim world and more than most countries anywhere. Consequently, the course on \"Revolutionary Iran\" addresses the following question: is there anything peculiar or particular about Iran that could explain the rise of modern revolutionary movement?

How can nations best prepare to prevent violent conflicts or to win them if they occur? What has determined success and failure and the intensity, duration, and consequences of military action?

This course is designed to gain leverage on the processes that explain such changes by surveying an eclectic literature on comparative and transnational LGBT politics: from social movements to normative change in international relations. For these fields of study, the changes addressed above pose several important questions. It is no coincidence, for example, that dozens of countries now grant some form of same-sex unions, and understanding transnational politics helps us understand why. Specially, we will ask: What factors have facilitated the mobilization of LGBT people? Why and how have public opinion and state laws towards LGBT people changed differently across various countries?"

    "description": "This course will explore the past, present, and future role of media in shaping global change, and guide students in the development of a global media campaign. The campaign will be the culmination of an inquiry around media as a tool for social change. From pivotal news events of the last twenty years, to the rise of reality television, social media, and declining influence of print and broadcast journalism, this course will use media literacy case studies and comparative analysis of news coverage and critical analysis of cinema trends in art and culture to explore media's impact on social norms and cultural-narratives. Specifically, we will examine the role of media in various revolutions worldwide - the recent role of social media in the overthrow and transition of the Egyptian government (the Square), the role of song in South Africa's struggle for freedom, and international news coverage of the Feminist Movement and the Black Panther party. How is it that movements are organized using media as a tool for social change? Professional writers, media executives, and branding experts will be guest speakers for viewing-salons that will be scheduled throughout the semester. Students will learn media literacy skills and develop critical thinking by engaging with the role media plays in major historical, cultural, and social issues; become active learners as they gain proficiency to approach their own personal inquiries with creativity and scholarly rigor; gain expression through visual storytelling, data visualization, and social media, as they create their own global media campaign and present it at a final salon for the course; and participate in the shaping of the narrative around global social change."

Soft power lies in the ability to attract and persuade, whereas hard power - the ability to coerce - grows out of a country's military or economic might, especially in an imperial/colonial period. Students will analyze how trade, culture (music, food, sports, language, education), environment, and political institutions (democracy, corruption, human rights, etc.) contribute to a country's soft power and make up its global brand. Students will analyze the current state of soft power in key nations and consider how countries and their citizens can affect the attractiveness of a country's culture, ideas, and institutions in order to raise its soft power. The course will introduce students to the idea of global sustainable diplomacy, which pursues global goals using soft, not hard, power."

More specifically, the course will deal with: (1) the evolving meaning of prevention as it was understood in the Charter of the United Nations and subsequently shaped by the changing causes and nature of conflicts; (2) the main actors in conflict prevention against the backdrop of UN institutions; (3) the tools and practice of \"operational\" prevention (i.e. early warning, mediation, sanctions, peace operations, peace enforcement, and the role of regional organizations); (4) the tools and practice of \"structural\" prevention (good governance and democracy, mainstreaming human rights and gender, meeting post conflict reconstruction, and addressing the root causes of conflict); and (5) the significance of the emerging norm of the \"responsibility to protect\".

This course provides a historical survey of the evolution of U.S. urban schooling, tracing its development from the earliest community-based, one-room schoolhouses, to modern major urban unified school districts. We explore the roles that industrialization and immigration have played in the urbanization of communities, and the ways in which schools have adapted in order to provide for the socialization of the urban worker. We examine shifts in the politics of public education as it pertains to control over schools and schooling and the various stakeholders involved. We conclude with a look at the evolving roles of the teacher, school counselor, and the administrator - as well as a glimpse into what the future holds for both traditional and alternative forms of public schooling in urban school communities across the U.S."

We will study the films of Ernst Lubitsch, Billy Wilder, Fritz Lang, Robert Siodmak, Michael Curtiz, and Otto Preminger, paying particular attention to how they formulated key aspects of film noir and romantic comedy. While film noir paints a bleak picture of passion, violence, and desperation in American culture, the rom com structure promises pleasure and reconciliation, transgressive zaniness wedded to social order. But films in these two contrasting genres often tell different versions of the same story, or provide entangled perspectives on related American possibilities, and we will continually compare them in order to consider issues of cinematographic technique and style, plot and tone, agency and structure, capitalism and class, gender and sexuality, as well as race and power. Throughout the course, we\u2019ll learn to think about how these filmmakers experienced exile, and how that experience made its way into their films. In addition to coming away with a basic grasp of film history and analysis, as well as the importance of genre in the evolution of American cinema, students will also learn about the early history of Hollywood and the complex relationship between Jewishness, antifascism, and whiteness in the first half of\u00a0the 20th century."

We will also read Renaissance romances about the challenges of tempering the desire for revenge (Cervantes, Spenser). Our study of these literary works will enable us to understand key developments in the legal and religious thinking of Renaissance Europe (especially England), and the relevance of these innovations to the complex role revenge plays in our current moment. We will likewise survey some influential philosophers of revenge from antiquity to the present, and if time allows, we\u2019ll examine the importance of revenge to contemporary fiction and film. Some questions we\u2019ll ask include: How have artists imagined the desire for and consequences of revenge? What cultural and legal structures have been constructed to produce, mediate, temper, or sublimate vengefulness? How have modern conceptions of justice relied on, or occluded, revenge? When does revenge uphold structures of oppression and when can it aid in resisting or abolishing them?

Fewer realized that surrealist aesthetic techniques\u00a0were being practiced at the exact same time\u00a0within the Black Diaspora, among its Francophone, Anglophone, and Hispanophone speakers. Surrealism attracted artists, intellectuals, and activists from so many different cultures because it surpassed previous avant-garde art movements in linking creativity to a critique of colonialism. It is not surprising that surrealism found a special expression in the African Diaspora."

Notably, poets have shifted American consciousness without losing sight of artistic experimentation. Poetic genres, in this course, are more than familiar literary conventions.\u00a0 They are ways of thinking and feeling. Poets experiment with literary form in hopes of staying true to the nation's complexities. Fragmentation, intertextuality, ekphrasis, and erasure are all crucial techniques for exploring beauty, mental health and disability, immigration and war. This course will examine several award-winning poets, including Kevin Young, Molly McCully Brown, Robin Coste Lewis, Solmaz Sharif, and Philip Metres."

We will play into and take seriously Toni Morrison\u2019s conception of memory as\u00a0a form of willed creation, in an ongoing attempt to reanimate forgotten or unrealized aspects of our histories and ourselves. Students will generate new work constantly\u2014in sketchbooks, exercises, and story drafts\u2014paying attention to the honing of various craft elements (description, dialogue, character and plot development), and in correspondence with texts by a variety of exemplary practitioners of fiction and prose writing (Venita Blackburn, K-Ming Chang, Fleur Jaeggy, Jamaica Kincaid, Maxine Hong Kingston, Li-Young Lee, Clarice Lispector,\u00a0Scholastique Mukasonga,\u00a0Nh\u00e3 Thuy\u00ean,\u00a0among others).

The goal of this class will be to persuade you, to the contrary, that the literature written during the period beginning with Chaucer's Canterbury Tales in the late 14th century and ending with Milton's Paradise Lost in the 17th century constitutes one of the most exciting and experimental moments in literary history, one that offers uniquely relevant lessons for contemporary thinking about community and storytelling, narrative and memory, truth and perception, race and power, as well as gender and sexuality. At the same time, we will explore what is productively strange, challenging, and even alienating about these texts from the past, measuring how their distance from us provides unique opportunities for thinking. We will also examine how authors such as Chaucer, Shakespeare, Spenser, and Milton came to constitute the foundation of the English literary canon, and how this canon has been used to advance (or to critique) English national and colonial ideologies. Together we\u2019ll explore a set of analytic concepts and strategies for interpreting their unique texts that will make you a more sensitive, precise, and persuasive reader and writer."

From Homer's The Odyssey and Grimm's fairytales, to Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and Salman Rushdie's Shame,\u00a0monsters challenge our everyday ideas about normality. Situated between the animal and the human, monstrous creatures are ciphers for difference that force us to consider what we regard as culturally abject or grotesque, as well as alluring. That these mythical figures continue to fascinate even as they frighten, is suggestive of their symbolic power in embodying both our latent desires and prohibitions. This course will explore the emergence of the monstrous aesthetic across several genres (epic, drama, novel, poetry, film) and periods (Renaissance to contemporary) to probe the shifting terrains of sexual, racial, and cultural otherness that monsters represent. Along the way, we will ask critical questions that arise from the study of monstrosity. What, for instance, separates monsters from humans? How does monstrosity define our notions about beauty and ugliness, desire and disgust? Does the monster appear each time under a different guise? If so, to what extent does it reshape our sensibility about what is socially abnormal? What can monsters teach us about the hopes and apprehensions of the cultures and times to which they belong? Ultimately, we will seek to understand how and why these ferocious figures also elicit sympathy in us toward those markedly unlike ourselves. Our reading list includes works by: Alfred Tennyson, William Blake, R.L. Stevenson, Mary Shelley, Patricia Highsmith, among others."

No prior knowledge of Middle English or medieval literature required. We will contextualize our work by looking at religious, philosophical, and medical texts about death, yet our focus will be on scenes of death, burial, mourning, and memorial in literary texts by Chaucer, the Pearl Poet, Julian of Norwich, and others. Asking how we can construe the ethical and political imagination of the medieval English literary world, we will also consider larger issues related to the literary awareness of death: the representability of death; the political and generic function of consolation, tragedy, and elegy; death's relations to the sacred and the sovereign; the economics of death in the age of the plague; war and martyrdom; mourning and rebellion; dreams and the afterlife; gender, living, death, and anchoritism."

    "name": "The Literature of Error: Romance and Genre",
    "description": "Before the modern novel, we had romance: the literature of error and erring, stories of characters who set out on a quest and lose their way due to madness, obsession, lack of faith, or the difficulty of knowing the truth about themselves or their quests. Romance was one of the most important genres of imaginative literature in medieval and Renaissance Europe, and yet it was also the one that provoked the most profound moral and aesthetic concern. Hugely popular, romance was often condemned for its endless attention to pleasure, pain, error, and forgetting, for its perverse magical stories of exploration and complicity, for its unseemly analysis of chivalric duty and obsession--and even for its capacity to corrupt its readers beyond repair. (Famously, Don Quixote was driven mad by reading romances!) Whether viewed as a genre of utopian dreaming or of lurid and dangerous narrative failure, romance is a vexed concept. By examining pre-modern and modern genre theory, this class will explore the formation of the category of romance across medieval and Renaissance England (with some attention paid to France, Italy, and Spain), thus giving students an opportunity to consider how genre can enable and constrain understanding of particular works of literature. Texts may include Virgil's Aeneid, Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes Arthurian tales, Geoffrey Chaucer's Troilus and Crisyede, the anonymous Pearl-Poet\u2019s Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Miguel de Cervantes's Don Quixote, Philip Sidney\u2019s Arcadia, Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queene, William Shakespeare\u2019s Cymbeline, and Mary Wroth\u2019s Urania. At the end of the semester, we may turn to more recent works (such as Samuel R. Delany's speculative fictions or Caroline Bergvall's poetics of error) to get a sense of how pre-modern romance remains an archive for some of the most exciting literary production today."

Canvassing the ways \u201clyric\u201d has functioned as a term for particular kinds of expression, thought, and classification, this class will provide students with a set of tools to read and write about an archive of short poetry from the sixteenth century to the contemporary moment. Even though it is ostensibly the most personal and hermetic of literary genres, lyric poetry is often produced by what the philosopher Theodor Adorno calls a \u201ccollective undercurrent\u201d--a complex shuttling between individual voice and the social structures that shape the forms and possibilities of expression. We will attend to how lyric has crystalized different historically situated understandings of self and society, with an eye towards how the form of a short poem exposes aesthetic, philosophical, and political questions of great urgency.\u00a0"

We will read key works in Marxist theory, along with literary and historical texts by authors such as Christopher Columbus, Thomas More, Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas, Edmund Spenser, and William Shakespeare, in order to study representations of race, economy, and environmental extraction in the fictions that some early modern Europeans told about their role in a new global society."

Four main topics will organize the course: punishment and colonialism; the economic, theological, rhetorical, and theatrical underpinnings of legal trial; martyrdom; and the rise of the transatlantic slave trade. Each section of the course is divided into a series of sub-topics (ranging from questions of genre and psychology, to the humanist culture of teaching) to be explored through examination of a literary text and related historical and theoretical materials.

    "description": "This course examines the increasing centrality of the theme of \"tyranny\" to American literature before 1900. Most people know the founders justified the American Revolution\u00a0 as a response to Britain's tyranny during the colonial period. Fewer know that \"tyranny\" became a watchword for national debates over race, gender, and class conflicts. What happens to the idea of \"tyranny\" when it refers to threats within a nation rather than outside forces? What happens when the calls for revolution that founded the nation are asserted once again, to save the nation from its worst self? The political and ethical political implications of this 18th and 19th century conflict reverberate today. Only a multi-genre approach, incorporating a wide range of authors, could do justice to these questions. For these reasons, we will examine revolutionary pamphlets, speeches, essays, freed-persons narratives, and poetry from authors as diverse as Joseph Warren, Phillis Wheatley, Phillip Freneau, Harriet Jacobs, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Walt Whitman, and Emily Dickinson. Finally, this course listens to voices too often obscured by our focus on well-known characters in American history: the unofficial soldiers of the American Revolution, the freed-persons who emancipated themselves from slavery, the conflicted Civil War Veterans, and the working-class Americans trying to find their place in Reconstruction-era America.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Major Requirement Met: Group II"

How to distinguish fugitives fighting for freedom from unprincipled outlaws? Is emancipation a single act, legal declaration or a more complicated process? And for whom? Finally, how do we grapple with the backlash to political change? By focusing on the 19th century, we can rethink how African Americans found political agency generations before the most familiar events from the Civil Rights era. Most of all, this course allows students to read literature alongside historical documents, so they can see firsthand how debates over freedom evolved in the 19th\u00a0century.\u00a0"

    "description": "Since the 2008 Crash, politicians, scholars, and journalists have compared America's current economic challenges to the Great Depression.\u00a0This frequent comparison does not exhaust the significance of the Great Depression for the U.S. or the rest of the world. The 1930s is such an intriguing decade because the global economic collapse spawned new, or renewed older, political and artistic movements. In the global 1930's, people considered art central to rethinking political allegiances and the overarching meaning of politics itself. The 1930s helps to clarify the following question in our present-day: what cultural rebuilding remains to be done and how does art contribute to such processes? Writers of the 1930's took up this question in several different forms: through the trope of the document and its archival drive, the unconscious and the search for the Marvelous, the raised fist of labor movements or anti\u00adracist activism. This course will look at several literary (and related art) movements in, and cutting across, America, the Caribbean, and Europe. Texts will include (but are not limited to) documentary writing from Muriel Rukeyser, Richard Wright, and Langston Hughes; Surrealist writing from Europe and the Caribbean, including Aime Cesaire and Georges Bataille; and other forms of art like the photography of Cathy Cahun."

Neo-Nazism is not an exclusively German phenomenon, though - we find similar developments in other European countries in Canada and in the U.S. This course will track the activities of Neo-Nazis in Germany from 1990 to the present. We will analyze the impact of unification on the growth of right-wing militancy throughout Germany, and examine examples of Neo-Nazi and skinhead activities, as well as the efforts of various governments to control this movement. A key question will be why exactly young people between the ages of 15 and 30 are drawn to these groups that often use and develop sophisticated networks. Finally, the question will be asked as to what the most effective means of combating these movements would, or should, be. Not open to first year students."

In this course we will read some of the central texts in which these thinkers developed their revolutionary models of analysis: historical materialism, post-metaphysical philosophy, and psychoanalysis. Though different, what all three of these thinkers had in common was a rejection of the rational subject and with it the notion that commonplace social norms involved in knowledge, morality, and sexuality represented timeless and universal truths determined by a neutral subjectivity. Instead, each sought to explain how these norms were in fact social constructions that are best explained by analyzing the specific historical and sociological conditions in which they arose. For Marx, this project involved an analysis of how power and class relations contribute to the production of \u201cideology\u201d, for Nietzsche an investigation into the history and transformation of morality, and Freud the exploration of the unconscious. The result is a radical transformation of our understanding of subjectivity and a realization of the deeply contingent and malleable nature of human existence. We will investigate these theories by examining works of Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud within their contemporaneous contexts, drawing on the literature, art, and music of the time as well as more recent history and film as points of elucidation and comparison. This course will meet three times a week. Twice with CSLC 107 with discussion conducted in English, and a third weekly meeting in which all readings and discussions will be conducted in German."

Starting with the writings of Johann Caspar Lavater, whose monumental \"Physiognomic Fragments\" (1775-1778) advocated physiognomy as a means of \"promoting human understanding and human love,\" this course will explore the widespread influence that the art of interpreting physical features had in the intellectual and artistic milieu of the 18th century, and, arguably, continues to exert in the modern day. We will examine physiognomy in the aesthetic, cultural, literary, and scientific contexts of the German Enlightenment, dealing with such major figures as Goethe, Lessing, Lichtenberg, Schiller, and Hegel, as well as its unprecedented boom in popularity around 1900, when it was embraced by many prominent strands of German thought, from the \"philosophy of life\" (Nietzsche, Spengler, Kassner) and literary modernism (Rilke, Benn, Musil), to eugenics, criminology, and racial biology. In concluding with the rise of Nazism and their attacks on modern art as \"degenerate,\" the course will assess to what extent Walter Benjamin's thesis that \"[t]here is no document of civilization which is not at the same time a document of barbarism\" holds true for the historical trajectory of German thought. Topics include: the relationship between texts and images, theories and practices of interpretation, as well as the complicity of the arts and sciences in constructing theories of racial difference.

Throughout the semester, we will examine different \u201cscenes of writing,\u201d from the \u00e9criture automatique of the Age of Romanticism (Lichtenberg, Hoffmann, Goethe) to the mechanized typewriting of classical modernism (Nietzsche, Freud, Heidegger, Benjamin, Kafka), and consider how literature\u2019s imperative of dramatizing writing frames the protocols of communication that guide a given literary work. We will also interrogate the different ways in which writing has been theorized in modernity: as a self-referential symbolic practice; as a form of communication in which memory, experience, and knowledge are produced, articulated, and organized; and as a procedure of inscription in which language, technology, and bodily gesture are inextricably intertwined.

    "description": "What is despair and what does it tell us about being human that we alone can seemingly experience it? Is it equivalent to sadness or depression? Can it be relieved by material wealth, fame, success? For Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard despair was not a passing temporal condition but something that in itself points beyond itself to the possibility of its own overcoming. In doing so, despair, for Kierkegaard, forces open the crucial existential question: What does it mean to be a self? This course will examine this question by exploring changing conceptions of selfhood and despair from antiquity to modernity, moving from Achilleus\u2019 despairing rage in the Iliad to Dostoyevsky\u2019s depiction of the individual revolting against society in the Notes From the Underground and culminating in the seemingly irredeemable despair of Cormack McCarthy. Readings will include works by Homer, Plato, Thucydides, the Stoics, Marguerite of Porete, Meister Eckhart, Martin Luther, Soren Kierkegaard, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Leo Tolstoy, Franz Kafka, Cormack McCarthy, and Flannery O\u2019Connor. In addition to the English section, this course will meet for an additional session per week to read the and discuss the German language and other supplementary texts in their original.

    "description": "This course will investigate the concept of madness as both a social category and\u00a0one of the crucial terms of art and literature.\u00a0 On the one hand, madness often carries with it a negative connotation, as a statement or mental state beyond the realm of sense. Yet on the other, aesthetic theory has long considered madness\u00a0a necessary condition of great art. For the philosopher Immanuel Kant, the art of the genius must break the rules of style and\u00a0explode the bounds of the ordinary sense in order to be exceptional. Art, in this sense must necessarily push the boundaries of the normal, straddle the realms of\u00a0madness and sanity and, in doing so, transform the categories we use to understand the world. Thus by seeing madness not as some eternal category, but as constructed and deconstructed in concrete contexts,\u00a0the dialectic of madness and genius forces upon us\u00a0the following questions: How does the concept of madness get constructed? Who gets to decide who is and isn't mad and why? Why is the creation of art so tightly bound up with concept of madness? What does this tell us about how we make sense of the world and the possibilities of changing our own forms of understanding? We will investigate these questions by reading works of literature and philosophy that directly and indirectly address issues of madness and its relationship to creativity. \u00a0Readings\u00a0will include works by Michel Foucault, Franz Kafka, Heinrich von Kleist, Honore de Balzac, Virginia Woolf,\u00a0Deleuze & Guattari, Goethe,\u00a0Adalbert Stifter, Immanuel Kant,\u00a0and Ralf Waldo Emerson."

    "description": "This course will be centered around an in-depth investigation of one of the most controversial and influential philosophers of the 20th Century, Martin Heidegger. Rejecting what he saw as the tradition of western metaphysics and its quest for absolute knowledge, Heidegger's phenomenological\u00a0approach focused on an analysis of lived experience\u00a0and the structures that make that experience possible. Fundamental to this analysis are the ideas of finitude and fallibility. Human beings, for Heidegger, are never closed and completed, secure in their knowledge and understanding of themselves, but beings who are fundamentally concerned with their own being, who seek to determine themselves from within the complex social, historical, and interpersonal contexts into which they were thrown. As such, philosophy, for Heidegger, becomes interpretation, the attempt to interpret and reinterpret oneself and one's place within a changing and complex world, always with the possibility of failure. The course will investigate this project of \"existential hermeneutics\" through an in-depth investigation of some of Heidegger's major writings. The first half of the course will focus on a close reading of the first half of\u00a0Being and Time\u00a0while in the second half we will look at Heidegger's post war essays, his turn to \"poetic thinking\" and the legacy of Heidegger's thought on 20th century Continental philosophy.

But what was the Enlightenment?\u00a0This course will investigate the Enlightenment in all its complexities and contradictions. As an era defined by radical critique, Enlightenment thinkers rejected the authority of religion, tradition, and aristocracy, and sought to transform our understanding of nature, culture, and history by grounding these fields\u00a0on the transparent rational principles of freedom, progress, and universality. In doing this, the Enlightenment embroiled itself and us in a contradiction. It\u00a0both created the fundamental terms, ideals, and institutions\u00a0that frame our contemporary understanding of the world\u00a0while also establishing a discourse of universality and eurocentrism that serves as the object of our greatest critique. Yet far from being one thing, the Enlightenment also possessed the tools for its own self critique. Or, in the words of Johann Gottfried Herder, \"What is universal reason but a cover for our favorite, whims, idolatry, blindness and laziness.?\" Following, Herder, Rousseau, and Goethe, this course will also investigate the alternative conceptions of nature, culture, and history that rejected the universalist and imperialist strand of Enlightenment thinking in favor of a dynamic, process-oriented understanding of history and nature as\u00a0eternally unfolding. With this conception, the Enlightenment perhaps offers\u00a0an alternative to help us in our quest to think beyond it.

They came into adulthood to realize that their parent\u2019s generation were if not perpetrators then\u00a0at least accomplices to one of the gravest genocides in human history, that they had enthusiastically endorsed a fascistic manic, that the\u00a0country they inhabited\u00a0stood in ruins, bombed to the ground morally and physically, and that they now stood at the epicenter\u00a0of the cold war, half capitalist, half communist. From the perspective of the 68ers, the worst of all was that there had been no cultural\u00a0reckoning. With the conclusion of the Nuremberg trials and the prosecution of the elite Nazi administration, the majority of the population seemed content to simply to forget. For the 68ers that was not an option. Rather than view the WWII and the Holocaust as an aberration and horrific exception to German culture, the youth of the 68er generation demanded a revolutionary reevaluation of everything German. They asked: What factors, economic, social, cultural, and historical, led to this catastrophe? How can we come to terms with this past? And what vision of a transformed future could replace the old? The answer to these questions involved a three-step approach. A radical critique of the past and the structures of nationalism, patriarchy, heteronormativity, racism, and capitalism, which they believed were the foundational underpinnings of German fascism. Active political dissent that demanded change and culminated in the domestic bombings of the left-wing group the Red Army Faction. And a total re-conception of the norms of society, sexuality, and selfhood perhaps best represented in the Love Parade and the drugs, sex, and radical experimentation that fueled the raves and Berlin techno scene after the fall of the Berlin Wall."

In this course, we shall attempt to come to terms with three of the most important - and provocative - philosophers of the last two hundred years, philosophers without whom the great majority of contemporary literary and cultural theory (and much art and literature, itself) would, essentially, be unthinkable. Significantly, all three of these philosophers habitually turned to ancient Greek tragedy in the formulation, articulation, and further elaboration of their thought. In this course, we shall therefore attempt to use the experience of Greek tragedy, in all its ecstatic strangeness, as a powerful point of entry into the difficult, yet crucial, works these philosophers have bequeathed to us. Major texts to be covered include: the plays of Aeschylus and Sophocles, The Phenomenology of Spirit, The Birth of Tragedy, Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Being and Time, and Introduction to Metaphysics."

    "description": "The mythic queen Clytemnestra kills her husband and is murdered by her son who seeks to avenge his father. The sorceress Medea murders her two sons to punish her unfaithful husband. Classical drama revels in depicting villainous and violent women such as these, so much so that this practice inspired a contemporaneous comedy where Athenian women plot to kill the tragic playwright Euripides for his slanderous portrayal of the female sex. This course will consider the depiction of women in select Athenian plays of the 5th century BCE. We will read Aeschylus' Oresteia trilogy, Euripides' Medea, Aristophanes' Thesmophoriazusae, and selections from contemporary scholars. We will examine these figures in their dramatic and historical context to acquire a deeper understanding of how the concept of woman is articulated on the Athenian stage. This course meets with CSLC 181 and is for students who will be reading texts in the original Greek."

In this class, we shall attempt to answer the question of why style matters so deeply to us by relating the history of stylistic preferences (from ancient to modern times) to the history of metaphysics, to the question of Being itself. In other words, this course will test the thesis that our preferences for electric guitar over acoustic, for oil paint over water color, for free verse over iambic pentameter, have less to do with this or that particular thing within the world than they do with the way we answer the question of how or why there is a world for us, at all. The Greek section of this course will be devoted to translation of\u00a0The Iliad from the original, paying particular attention to the ways in which the Homeric epic has been received in the almost three millennia since its original appearance\u037e this will give our investigation into the history of style in the West (and its possible metaphysical grounds) a carefully delimited focal point."

    "description": "There has been no shortage of disciplines and institutions that have sought to convince us that we interact with our world primarily through our minds. But one form of literature, at least, has always known otherwise. For no matter what philosophy, religion, ethics, or the law try to tell us, comedy will never let us forget that we exist, in this world at least, in and through our bodies. The bodies of comedy, however, unlike the bodies of science, art, or athletics, are neither orderly, nor inspiring, nor ideal. The comedic body is unruly, excessive, needy, offensive\u2014in a word, impolite. What is special about comedy, however, as this class will endeavor to show, is that it encourages us not to despair over our shared condition of gross embodiment, but rather to unite ourselves around it. Comedy creates community from the shared experience of our bodies\u2014 from our corpulent, crapulent, concupiscent corporeality. Having no interest in the maintenance of an ideal \"body politic,\" comedy rejoices in the humble togetherness of a \"body impolitic.\" Though this course will aim to establish a history of comedy from the ancient Greeks and Romans to the Medieval, Renaissance, and Restoration eras (and beyond), it will also make constant reference to modern comedic phenomena; the sit-com, the rom-com, the stand-up, the parody, and the roast\u2014to name but a few. In addition to attending the 3 hours of lecture required of students in CSLC 285, students in Greek 385 are required to attend an additional 90 minutes of class per week to read and discuss texts in the original language.\u00a0Students in this course are required to complete a 10-12-page interpretive paper, one that incorporates the students' own translations of original texts.

Traditionally, of course, the myth of Ulysses has been understood as a rather sentimental myth of nostos, or \"homecoming\": the hero, forced by fate into hateful foreign places, finally wins his way back to the security, stability, and contented self-\u00adsufficiency of his own native land. Or so the story goes. In this course, however, we will test the thesis that something more like the opposite of this interpretation may hold true. It may be, in other words, that the wanderings of the Ulysses figure (whether through the seas of the Mediterranean, the streets of Dublin, or the isles of the West Indies) work not so much to affirm the self\u00ad-sufficiency and comfort of home, as to trouble and destabilize it. What the heroes of these works might finally come to understand - and may even rejoice in - is not the idea that there is \"no place like home,\" but rather that, in the end, it is only within a certain placelessness that we are ever really \"at home,\" at all. This course will be offered in conjunction with CSLC 286, but will meet for an additional 90 minutes per week to read Homer's Odyssey in the original Greek."

The sheer intellectual abundance of this work is, of course, well known: in its ten chapters it provides seminal reflections on--among other things\u2014justice, psychology, music, literature, the nature of truth, economics, political science, math, physics, gender, mortality and immortality (to name but a few of its multifarious concerns). And yet, as this course shall argue, the work itself\u2014and in some ways, the entirety of Plato\u2019s literary and philosophic oeuvre\u2014might be understood as structured around a single question: namely, how are we to connect the experience of human desire with the necessity of human community? We shall be devoting one week to each chapter of this great work, and two weeks apiece to Chapters Five, Six and Seven. Beyond the reading of individual chapters, students will be asked to provide, week by week, a detailed commentary on selected passages in the original Greek, and summations of assigned secondary literature. Where possible we shall attempt to relate the arguments of The Republic to relevant passages in other Platonic dialogues (in particular, The Symposium, Gorgias, the Phaedo, and The Laws)."

By the 4th century BCE, Plato seems to have concluded that philosophy must eschew any interest in the flesh, inasmuch as flesh (whatever it may be) cannot yield to precise, philosophical investigation. Perhaps even more crucially, Plato stipulated that flesh cannot and should not be the basis of a politics, as it is only philosophical insight, in its disciplined refusal of the lure of the flesh, that could serve as the ground of genuine political communion. From here it was but a short step to conclude that poetry (and of course, \"art in general\"), entangled as it was with the body, could have little meaning or import for the practice of either politics or philosophy."

Of particular interest in this course will be the theme of cross-cultural interactions in the midst of transforming economies, an expanding nation, and unequal power relations. We will combine a broad introduction to early American history with an in-depth look at five case studies of individuals and communities encountering each other across borders of nation, religion, race, gender, ethnicity, and class. Each case study offers a unique perspective on the question of how broad economic structures of colonization, slavery, and the market revolution shaped human encounters between natives and newcomers, captives and captors, slaves and slaveholders, Northerners and Southerners. Ultimately, these case studies encourage a critical rethinking of concepts of liberty, equality, and democracy, which have formed the bedrock of master narratives in United States history. Within the context of these broad, sweeping themes, we will look closely at primary historical documents, produced by men and women of their time period, and we will carefully read the arguments of historians in our own time.

Yet, by Jefferson's day, it was already too late. North America had been dotted with great metropolises and minor towns for thousands of years, and new waves of European and African settlers founded hundreds of new ones, as well. Indeed, for many early migrants, America was itself a \"city on the hill\" - an urban image for a new society. In this course, we will survey American urban history from those early days to the present, focusing, in the second half, specifically on Los Angeles, where new forms of decentralized urbanism took form in the 20th century. We will not only explore suburbia and freeways, Disneyland, and other quasi\u00adurban outposts, but also the changing character of the inner city in the mid-20th century, as well as radical efforts to reform existing American cities. In the process, we encounter the American city of today - multicentered, privately planned, decentralized, and multiethnic. We will conclude by asking whether contemporary developments in urbanism - the changing character of public space, the turn to privatism, the neglect of public transport infrastructures, and challenges to democracy and equality - are ultimately compatible with the American dream of the \"city on the hill\" for the 21st century."

Specific topics include: U.S. overseas imperialism, the U.S. role in both World Wars and the Cold War, the heightened significance of Asia and the Pacific World after 1940, internationalism and the creation of the United Nations, the emergence of the Third World and Washington's ambivalent relationship to global decolonization, Americans' involvement in the global revolutions of the 1960's, the economic upheavals of the 1970's, the end of the Cold War, and the politics of a post-Cold War and post-9/11 world."

    "description": "With its capital in Europe since 1363 and spanning Europe, Asia and Africa for nearly five centuries the Ottoman Empire was perhaps the most successful and longest enduring experiment in multiculturalism the world has ever known. Multi-lingual, multi-ethnic and multi-religious Ottoman society and culture were comprised of Muslim, Byzantine Christian, Turkish, Greek, Persian, Mongol, Slavic, Armenian, Arab, African and Jewish cultural elements. Edicts from the Ottoman state were regularly issued in nine languages. One reason for its longevity was its willingness to draw on the diversity of this rich historical and cultural tableau. In this course, we will examine the complex social, cultural and political transformations occurring in the Ottoman Empire from its inception as a small principality in western Anatolia until it reached its zenith when it stretched into modern-day Austria."

Students will conduct original research into African American activism that stretched from New York to California before and after the U.S. Civil War. We will explore the social networks and political institutions that 19th-century African Americans built to fight for civil rights, economic justice, and an end to chattel slavery. At the heart of the course is a digital humanities component that will involve students in researching the lives and ideas of individual Black activists. At the end of the course, we will contribute our collective research to the national website, Colored Conventions. While engaged in original historical research, students will also be reading exciting scholarship on the rise of free Black communities in the U.S. and the emergence of African American institutions (churches, schools, press, political organizations). We will delve into questions such as: how did free African Americans, from leadership to grassroots levels, organize for racial equality, abolition, and community empowerment? How did class structures and gender ideology shape the dynamics of Black organizing? What transnational relationships and diasporic identities did Black activists build in the protracted struggles for abolition and citizenship?"

    "description": "The 1960s marks a watershed moment in American history, leading to a reexamination of everything from U.S. Foreign Policy (Vietnam and the Global South), to race (the Civil Rights Movement and Black Power), to gender (\"second\u00a0wave\" Feminism) and sexuality (\"Free Love\"). Culture was central to this transformative moment, contributing to a \"counter-culture\" that made distinct claims on our politics and even our most private modes of social interaction. If the \"personal is political\"--as the 60s mantra would have it--then something as seemingly ephemeral as \"style\" becomes a mode of resistance. Style as resistance was expressed in everything from slang of the time (summed up in the ubiquitous epithet of \"cool\"), to the theater of protest (and its ubiquitous musical soundtrack), even to something as seemingly ephemeral as dress and hair. In the process, the counter-culture of the 60s sought to rethink the nature of desire, the boundaries between public and private, the \"multiversity\" and the objectives of higher education,\u00a0the participation of women and \"minorities\" in society--and most especially, what it meant to be young. The focus of the course will be on the 1960s, but we will explore the ways in which culture, politics and history interact.\u00a0In particular we will examine the nature of cultural politics--its confusions and limitations as well as its liberatory potential--as an arena to address the era's most pressing social\u00a0concerns. Readings will include the seminal texts of the 1960s: \"The Port Huron\u00a0Statement, \"The Feminine Mystique,\u00a0The Autobiography\u00a0of Malcolm X;\u00a0along the cultural implications of some of its notable events such as the March on Washington, Woodstock\u00a0and the violence at\u00a0Altamont.\u00a0"

    "description": "No region of the country has been as saturated by mythology as the American West. It has been variously conceived as \"empty,\" a \"frontier,\" a \"garden of the world,\" the divine realization of the nation's \"manifest destiny\" (emblazoned in Occidental's motto). That expansionist mythology not only ignored the environmental limits to what John Wesley Powell memorably described as an \"impoverished landscape,\" it ran roughshod over the claims of indigenous peoples who lived there.\u00a0This course will examine the various ways in which mapmakers, historians, writers and artists have tried to challenge that mythology by reimagining\u00a0a different account (and future) of the American West. We will begin with reports from those\u00a0on the scene like Hinmatoowyalahqit (Chief Joseph) and Powell, turn to the historiography of the region\u00a0(from Turner to Limerick); and examine the efforts of\u00a0photographers (Curtis, R. Adams, Misrach); artists (Heizer, Turrell, Martinez and Luna); writers (Muir, Solnit, Erdrich) and filmmakers (Zhao).\u00a0Our investigation will linger on special regions and topics such as the efforts to map the West through early government surveys, the foundations of our national parks, the Nevada Test Site and the Cold War West,\u00a0the damming of the Colorado River and Hetch-Hetchy, and the efforts by indigenous writers to rethink some of the West's most infamous episodes (Welch, Vizener).\u00a0We will also devote some time to examining the approach taken to public history by nearby institutions like La Purisima Mission, the Autry Museum of the American West,\u00a0and the very different Center for Land Use Interpretation. Our goal throughout will be to follow the strategies by which these activists, historians, writers and artists attempt to transform a mythological\u00a0space\u00a0of \"heroic individualism\" and boundless appetite, into a\u00a0place\u00a0with a distinctive history, tradition, community--a place, that is, with claims on us of stewardship and accountability."

In the period between World War I and World War II, new and alternative models for the relationship between state and society challenged the existing political and social order, as many Europeans abandoned democracy as the ideal political system. Many turned to nationalist authoritarianism as the answer to the political, economic, and social crises shaking Europe. Italy, under the National Fascist Party, and Germany, ruled by the National Socialists, were the nations in which this flight from democracy became a full-fledged descent into dictatorship and one-\u00adparty rule. This course examines authoritarianism and dictatorship in interwar Europe and we assess how the elevation of the state and the nation, promoted by these regimes and parties, impacted the societies involved."

Central to this course is a focus on the discursive boundaries of civil society based on race and class. Throughout the course, we situate European developments in a world-historical framework as a way to understand the increasingly interdependent political, social, and economic relationships between Europe and the colonial periphery. We begin in fin de si\u00e8cle Europe, and trace the polarization of national politics and the development of the contending state ideologies of fascism and communism. We explore the consequences of various programs of decolonization, as well as the popular revolts against cultural diversity and post-colonial immigration to the metropole. The course also investigates the origins and consequences of the neo-liberal \"revolution\" of the 1980's, the ethnic violence stemming from the disintegration of the Soviet Union and eastern bloc nations, and the return of the radical right throughout Europe in the 1990's.

For the transformation in political theory from Lockean family representation to Suffragette individual representation in the state, we shall explore the literature on \"rights\" from Wollstonecraft to United Nations declarations on global Women's Rights & current revival of American movement for Equal Rights Amendment.

The course will be organized around historical case studies including medical inspection and quarantine of Southern and Eastern European and Asian immigrants at Ellis and Angel Islands and Mexicans at the U.S. border in the 1890s-1930s; race and epidemics in early twentieth century cities; mental health of European and Latin American political refugees in the post-World War II era; farm worker health and environmental justice movements since the 1960s; forced deportation of Caribbean migrants for HIV-positive status during the AIDS pandemic; maternal and reproductive health in post-1990s detention centers; and mutual aid during the COVID-19 crisis, among others. Taken together, students will discern how migration serves as a determinant of health, and also learn about migrant resilience despite structural violence. The themes of medical racism and scapegoating, contagion narratives, occupational health, health movements, cross-cultural health communication, and medical citizenship will anchor course units. With particular attention to the analytical categories of race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and class, the course posits that history can make a critical contribution to our understanding of health inequities and to the development of migrant health justice.

At times, working class women and women of color have also been demonized as carriers of contagion or even romanticized as repositories of traditional wisdom. Furthermore, women\u2019s roles in community health have been heavily shaped by gendered and racial constructions of the body, disease, and wellbeing.\u00a0 Thus, while the focus of the course is on the social history of women\u2019s health and healing, the theoretical framework of the course also aims to explore how ideologies of gender, race, class, and sexuality shape women\u2019s relationship to community health as both caregivers and health-seekers. The course is organized by a set of common themes that cut across time, space, and racial/ethnic boundaries in U.S. History.\u00a0 Themes include: spirituality and healing; work and health; sexuality and reproduction; activism for health justice.\u00a0 An important goal of this course is to make connections between historical studies of women and health and present-day community health activism. Much of the course and especially the community partnership component focuses on the leadership of women of color in shaping agendas for community well-being.\u00a0 In the past, course participants have worked with the organizations Black Women for Wellness, California Latinas for Reproductive Justice, Visi\u00f3n y Compromiso, and Promesa Boyle Heights. We will continue to work this year with women\u2019s health organizations and the Southern California Library on a Reproductive Justice community partnership.

In addition to looking at some of the empirical and theoretical problems inherent in defining and writing about \"peasants\" and \"tribes,\" we will also consider how nationalism complicates these issues even more. We will investigate the ways that rural populations were incorporated into, or excluded from, the processes of state-formation. Finally, we will look at how representations of peasant/tribe, in ideologies of state-building and nationalism, shaped social and political relations within some of the region's nation-states. While we will discuss the region as a whole, we will focus most of our attention on two empirical cases: Iraq and Egypt."

    "description": "Americans have long idealized the frontier as an untrammeled backcountry, a mythologized landscape of \u201ccowboys and Indians\u201d, prairie and homesteaders, ranchers and sodbusters. In this course, we will draw on colonial and postcolonial theory to reinterpret these stories in the historical context of a set of encounters involving the Americas and the Americans - native and immigrant, from Europe, Asia, and Africa - with the rest of the world, contacts that began in 1492 and are still going on today. In the process, we will explore a diverse array of borderlands between people, environments, mythologies, and histories - spaces of interaction and reinvention. But these borderland spaces are fragile; contact zones devolve, again and again, into conquest, domination, genocide, and empire. Although this is a transnational phenomenon, this course is primarily concerned with the frontier in North America and particularly in the American West and in California. Along the way, we will also be doing our own original archival research, so students will have a chance to make their own mark upon the long history of the American frontier experience.\u2028"

    "description": "The \"Great Books\" have been seen by many as the defining element within the tradition of\u00a0Western Civilization--a claim that has been the subject of fierce contemporary debate. In fact, the controversy\u00a0has a long history which\u00a0goes back at least as the \"Quarrel between the Ancients and the Moderns\" at the end of the 17th Century\u00a0and extends to Matthew Arnold's Victorian-era debate with T.H. Huxley over whether science has eclipsed the need for humanities.\u00a0In the United States there has been an ongoing skirmish over what to read in our universities that stretches from President Eliot's decision\u00a0to abandon the core curriculum at Harvard for an open,\u00a0elective system in the 1880s, to the furor that erupted with the publication of Allan Bloom's\u00a0The Closing of the American Mind\u00a0a century later. More recently Dan-el Padilla Peralta--a\u00a0professor of Roman History at Princeton--has advocated for abolishing the founding discipline of Classics altogether because of its entanglement with the\u00a0origin story of white supremacy.\u00a0\u00a0At the bottom of the debate over the canon\u00a0is the assumption that what we teach and read defines the culture as a whole, what we value, and who we are. It is a debate\u00a0over the tradition's\u00a0exclusivity and chauvinism.\u00a0 But it is also a debate over the relevance of the humanities in a world dominated by science and\u00a0the rigorous demands of preprofessional training--which is to say that it is a debate over modernity itself. Finally--and perhaps most controversially--it is\u00a0debate over a putative ideal of \"greatness\" and \"civilization,\" along with the role of the University in perpetuating that ideal, even as it plays the largely unexamined role of selecting leadership within a democracy. Clearly, much is at stake. This course will examine the many sides of this longstanding controversy among canon's\u00a0advocates, critics and reformers. We will also examine the attempt to\u00a0institutionalize various curricular models such as the Great Books program at Columbia University and the Athens-America program at University of Wisconsin (both in the 1920s), as well as the Experimental College at Berkeley in the 1960s. We will analyze their educational goals, read some of the books they assigned, and explore the viability of the Western Tradition as a usable past.\u00a0"

If we look a bit deeper, the Zoot Suit Riots, the scandal of Chavez Ravine, the destruction of public transit, and other more complex, and often \"noir\" images might emerge. Yet beneath both sets of images lie a set of crucial social, demographic, and political changes that marked Los Angeles's emergence as an industrial, as well as cultural, center - changes that put the city on the front lines of many struggles revolving around Civil Rights, housing, and the future of American urbanism itself. In this class, we will explore the sunshine and the noir of mid-twentieth century LA, focusing on the ways cultural forms (such as the Central Avenue Jazz Renaissance, film noir, and modern architecture) crystallize crucial postwar\u00a0social and political battles within this complex modern metropolis."

Using the survivor testimonies archived at the USC Shoah Foundation Visual History Archive and the museum installation at the Museum of Tolerance, we will interrogate the emerging fields of witnessing and testimony in relationship to the memory of the Holocaust and the phenomenon of Holocaust commemoration and memorialization. We will ask questions about how individuals and society assimilated to the experience of genocide: what narrative choices, what linguistic choices, and what visual choices did survivors and the larger culture make when remembering and commemorating the Holocaust?

    "description": "China is now undergoing one of the fastest rates of urbanization in world history. Just thirty years ago, about 80% of the Chinese population lived in the countryside, mostly working in agriculture. Today, China's population is over half urban, and the CCP has announced a new plan to speed up the urbanization process so that by 2020, 60% will be urban. Furthermore, well over 100 million migrants travel back and forth between the countryside and the city each year. While these numbers are impressive in and of themselves, it can be hard to understand what they mean for individuals, for particular social groups, and for the changing rural and urban landscapes. Nonetheless, this shift from a predominantly rural population to an urban focused society is both ambitious and fraught with problems. This class aims to give an in-depth and up\u00ad-close look at this amazing social transformation through readings, class lectures, film, research projects, and, most importantly, in-country experience. This course begins with a short semester on campus at Occidental and continues with a three\u00ad-week trip to China, including a home\u00adstay with a rural household.

The variety of natural and built environments in Mesoamerica has produced a diversity of social, cultural, and political landscapes. This seminar explores the ways in which different cultural groups have perceived, used, managed, and conserved the Mesoamerican environment from colonial times to the present. We will address a number of interrelated questions about the relationship between Mesoamerican societies and the environment. How have natural environments established parameters for human economic and social activity? How have Mesoamericans interpreted and then reshaped their environmental surroundings to satisfy their supposed needs? What impact have race and gender had on perceptions of the environment? What have been the environmental consequences of the colonial, subsistence, and agro-export economies the 19th century infatuation with progress and the 20th century creation of industrial and urban conglomerations under the aegis of developmentalist ideologies? What is the historical geography of five centuries of sustained degradation and sporadic conservation of Mesoamerica's bio-physical environments? How have different groups of Latin Americans interacted in their quest to manage, control, and distribute natural resources? We will pay particular attention to how the relationship between humans and their natural and built environments shaped Mesoamerica's social and political development."

The idea, actuality, and experience of genocide in the twentieth century have raised questions about the very nature of society and humanity. By studying the genocidal crises of the modern age, from the Armenian Genocide of 1915 to the Holocaust to the contemporary genocide in Darfur in the Sudan, we are forced to consider the darkest chapters of modern history and the ethical trauma that follows in their wake. While most students have heard of the Nazi-perpetrated Holocaust, which murdered the Jews of Europe, the other genocides of the last hundred years are less well known. This course, by comparing the societies which experienced genocide and the conditions which produced it, will examine the psychological, cultural, and societal roots of human cruelty, mass violence, and genocide.

According to this view sectarian (and ethnic) identities are static and consist of an unchanging essential core not only independent of historical, political and economic developments, but indeed even generative of them. For some, the Lebanese Civil War of 1975-1990 seemed to confirm the \u201csectarian thesis\u201d about the Middle East. \u00a0Indeed, the war-torn Lebanese capital, Beirut (divided as it was between an eastern \u201cChristian\u201d enclave and a western \u201cMuslim\u201d enclave), became a metonym for sectarian conflict.

    "description": "This course offers students the opportunity to read, in the original Latin and in translation, texts by or about non-elite people in the Roman world. In so doing, it attempts to recover the largely forgotten perspectives, experiences, interests, voices, and cultures of non-elite people in the Roman world, that is, the entire Mediterranean from 133 B.C.E. to 476 C.E. Today, we usually see Roman history and culture from the perspective of Rome\u2019s elites, because the bulk of the surviving texts were written by or for elites. We shall steer a different course, examining texts and material artifacts produced by, for, or about ordinary people. Topics include Roman childhood and the Roman family, kinship relations, mothering and motherhood, child-rearing practices, children\u2019s experience, the death of kin and commemorative practices; the economic circumstances of ordinary Romans, the nature of work, the terms of lending and borrowing, the experiences and cultures of slave-holding and of enslavement; women\u2019s roles as girl (puella), girlfriend (amica), wife (matrona), prostitute (meretrix), and witch (venefica); sex, sexuality, and dirty songs; the people\u2019s entertainments, such as theater, games, gladiator shows, and popular literature; popular politics and the role of the crowd and common person in public life; the culture of soldiering and the experience of peoples at the borders of empire; popular religious phenomena and the appeal of prophets, priests, and holy men in such movements as Isis worship, Mithraism, and Christianity. The goal of the course is for students to emerge with a holistic understanding of the details of and scholarly theories about non-elite culture in the Roman world, and hence with a heightened ability to identify and critically analyze contemporary discourses about \u201clow\u201d versus \u201chigh\u201d culture, which most often remain entirely implicit.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

For him, reality consisted of atoms and compounds of atoms situated in empty space. We will try to come to grips with Lucretius'\u00a0answers to questions such as the following: Where, in a purely physical world, is there a place for conscious beings like ourselves? Can we have free will and if so, how? Why do we suffer and what can we do to escape suffering? What makes life meaningful if the soul is not immortal? What does it mean to be a moral person if the gods take no interest in us or our actions? What do we owe each other, as creatures living\u00a0together in community? As we examine these questions we will also attend carefully to Lucretius'\u00a0poetic artistry, to the\u00a0rhetorical strategies by which he attempts to convert his audience, to his atomic physics, and to his place as a political thinker writing during the fall of the Roman republic. In this 5-unit course we will be reading Lucretius\u00a0in the original Latin, and will address the ways in which his poem's semantic content, syntax, and literary form work with (or against) one another to produce that texture of Roman cultural significance that is the\u00a0de Rerum."

Cognitive science offers explanatory paradigms for everything from the appeal of literary characters, dramatic irony, belief in gods, and animal sacrifice. Distributed cognition, that is, the thesis that cognition is embodied, enactive, embedded, and extended is appealed to for new perspectives on ancient theater, public spectacles, religious ceremonies, craft knowledge, and the production, display, and appreciation of architectural forms, sculpture, and paintings. Findings from the science of memory are brought to bear upon Roman strategies for remembering, for commemorating, and for purposely forgetting. Theories of culture drawn from evolutionary anthropology, developmental psychology, and philosophy of biology are adduced to cast new light on our evidence for Roman forms of participatory rather than instructional pedagogy, in-group / out-group formation,\u00a0prosocial and altruistic behavior, and mechanisms of cultural change. These topics will be examined through close readings in the original Latin drawn from\u00a0Cato the Elder, Cicero, Livy, Vitruvius, and others."

Epicurus, for example, wrote, \u201cThere is no use in philosophy, unless it casts out the suffering of the soul.\u201d In this course, we examine the therapeutic programs offered by various ancient philosophical schools: the Peripatetics (followers of Aristotle), Stoics (followers of Zeno of Citium), Epicureans (followers of Epicurus), Skeptics (two schools, one descending from Plato\u2019s Academy and the other from Pyrrho), and finally the Christian philosophy of Augustine of Hippo, which was informed by but also broke decisively with the Greco-Roman philosophical tradition that had preceded it. In order to understand the therapeutic programs of these schools, we shall first have to understand each school\u2019s account of human nature (\u201canthropology,\u201d in its original sense), of the mind or soul (\u201cpsychology,\u201d in its original sense), and of the purpose or \u201cend\u201d of human existence (\u201cethics\u201d). Each school\u2019s answer to the question of why we suffer and how we might find psychological peace\u00a0only makes sense in light of that school\u2019s beliefs about what it is to be human, what is the nature of the mind/soul, and what is the purpose of life. Our source materials in this investigation will include classic texts in ancient ethical thought: Cicero\u2019s Tusculan Disputations, a literary masterpiece cast as a dialogue among prominent Romans who had sought refuge in the countryside as the end of the Roman republic unfolded; Seneca\u2019s On tranquility of mind, which takes the form of a letter to his friend Serenus, who had sought him out to find relief from his distress; and the third book of Augustine\u2019s Confessions, which details the author\u2019s suffering under the afflictions of lust and the apparent paradox of his perverse delight in his own misery."

    "description": "The assassination of Pompey the Great in September of 48 B.C.E sealed the fate of the Roman republic. Pompey\u2019s military leadership had been the republicans\u2019 last hope of preserving Rome\u2019s constitutional order in the face of the dictatorial ambitions of Julius Caesar, who had in effect declared war on his own country in 49 B.C.E when he brought his army across the Rubicon river into Italy from Gaul. With Pompey gone, the republic was lost.\n\nSome Romans\u2014including the statesman, orator, and philosopher Marcus Tullius Cicero\u2014resisted Caesar with the pen, not the sword. In works such as On the Republic and On the Laws, Cicero articulated and urged upon his fellow citizens the merits of republican government, its basis in popular sovereignty, and the moral and political virtues of the rule of laws not men. A group of republican conspirators who sought to restore the old order assassinated Caesar in 44 B.C.E. They were, in turn, destroyed by Caesar\u2019s would-be heirs. In the tumult, Cicero was assassinated by the Caesarian faction for his political speech and activism.\n\nCicero\u2019s writings and their influence survived his assassination and have inspired opponents of tyranny and proponents of self-government for over 2000 years. In this course, we engage with the legacy of Roman republicanism, and its historically unprecedented regime of rights, laws, and constitutional norms. We read foundational texts by Cicero and the Roman historian Livy as well as by later political theorists who drew inspiration from them, such as Machiavelli, who re-introduced the theory of republican government into a Renaissance Europe ruled by princes in his 1517 treatise Discourses on Livy, and John Adams (the \u201cAmerican Cicero\u201d), whose 1787 work Defence of the Constitutions of the United States of America owed much to Ciceronian thought and made the Constitution that we have today\u2014the oldest constitution in the world, and one that many perceive as now under threat\u2014the world-changing document that it has proved to be."

In what ways have religious communities lead organized resistances? And even when mobilizing for liberation, to what extent can religion continue to solidify forms of oppression? We will seek to answer these questions through a series of case studies including: 1) a unique form of \u201cmuscular\u201d evangelical Christianity across Latin America after the Spanish-American War (1898) that sought to combat the oppressive powers that limited their sovereignty; 2) liberation theology and spiritual praxis within the Mexican American Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s; and 3) Latino/a global missionary efforts through various evangelical organizations.

Prominent historiographical themes for the course include: conflict between elite liberalism and mass mobilization; agrarian reform and unionization within a capitalist project of development; corporate representation of social interests; the institutionalization of revolution; race, gender, and class in nationalist rhetoric; and the role of art, education, and science/technology in state formation.

The variety of natural and built environments in Mesoamerica has produced a diversity of social, cultural, and political landscapes. This seminar explores the ways in which different cultural groups have perceived, used, managed, and conserved the Mesoamerican environment from colonial times to the present. We will address a number of interrelated questions about the relationship between Mesoamerican societies and the environment. How have natural environments established parameters for human economic and social activity? How have Mesoamericans interpreted and then reshaped their environmental surroundings to satisfy their supposed needs? What impact have race and gender had on perceptions of the environment? What have been the environmental consequences of the colonial, subsistence, and agro-export economies the 19th century infatuation with progress and the 20th century creation of industrial and urban conglomerations under the aegis of developmentalist ideologies? What is the historical geography of five centuries of sustained degradation and sporadic conservation of Mesoamerica's bio-physical environments? How have different groups of Latin Americans interacted in their quest to manage, control, and distribute natural resources? We will pay particular attention to how the relationship between humans and their natural and built environments shaped Mesoamerica's social and political development."

How can we learn in this moment from haptic technologies, haptic aesthetics, and uses of these in video games, virtual reality, digital-physical art installations, and even early moving pictures?

We will study how the disabling effects of disease affect musical performance (singing and playing), and how composers and performers have responded to and represented disease. Throughout, we will be alert to how differences in these responses are occasioned by historical time, geographical place, culture, race, sex, and class. We will begin in the early nineteenth century with the invention of the stethoscope, which turned close listening to the body as the principal means of detecting tuberculosis. The second unit of the course will study the disabling effects of TB on the composer-pianist Fryderyk Chopin, how he developed a piano method to accommodate that disability, and how the public perceived his music because of his illness. The third unit will study nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century musical stage representations of tuberculosis\u2014the operas La Traviata, The Tales of Hoffmann, La Boh\u00e8me, and The Fall of the House of Usher\u2014and consider them in terms of gender, class, health care, and moral codes. The fourth unit will address the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Here we will focus on Diamanda Galas\u2019s Plague Mass, the AIDS Quilt Songbook, and Jonathan Larson's Rent as political, cultural, and moral arguments. The fifth and final unit will study the musical responses to COVID-19, including the effects of COVID-19 on musicians and music-making, especially singing, and the wide range of public music performed by everyday citizens to honor frontline workers. By ending the course with frontline workers, we will examine the societal inequities that pandemics underscore and how music can give voice to those marginalized and disproportionately affected by a pandemic. Throughout the course, we will chart the vexed understanding of the relationship between mental and physical health, particularly in the presence of debilitating chronic disease."

The emergence of this tonal system enables instrumental music to sustain a listener's attention through dramatic forms and without the aid of words; comprehending how these forms behave is one of the central tasks of this course. In turn, the cultivation of instrumental genres will fuel the operatic accomplishments of Classical composers, notably Mozart. Our study of vocal and instrumental music proceeds chronologically and focuses on individual cities, starting with Florence at the end of the Renaissance and ending with Vienna, the music of Beethoven and Schubert, and the emergence of musical Romanticism. This course may be used by Music majors to fulfill the Second-Stage Writing Requirement. Not open to first-year students."

We then take up jazz, the radical experimentation of the 1920s ultra-modernists, and music under fascism. Thereafter, we study all subsequent major musical developments, through to post-minimalism and hip hop.

This course examines the evolution of this concept within and beyond the Wagnerian context, from its prehistory in eighteenth-century theories of beauty and taste, to sound film and music videos, to contemporary Los Angeles dining experiences (such as at Craig Thornton\u2019s Wolvesmouth and Jordan Kahn\u2019s Vespertine) that pick up where Wagner\u2019s theories left off. To chart this history will require us to consider theater, music, dance, painting, architecture, philosophy, film, and gastronomy. Throughout we will investigate\u00a0the roles\u00a0that attentiveness and perception play in these multi-sensory events, and consider how European thought and practices migrate and get translated to a contemporary, North American context.

Through these case studies\u2014which will include a focus on public health, the patient-provider relationship, reproductive health, and end-of-life care\u2014we will scrutinize the conceptual framing of health justice in the past, as well as the health justice foundations of contemporary practices, policies, and institutions.

What to say about these problems what they show us about how to understand space, time, infinity, truth, and reasoning are some of the issues we will discuss in this class.

    "description": "Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951) is a central figure in the two most important philosophical traditions of the twentieth century: First the attempt early in the century to characterize language thought and the world in terms of the newly available formalism of modern logic and second the attempt to show that any such formalization will fail to do justice to the rich complexity of language as a form of life a form inseparable from the social and historical context from which it springs. We will examine two principal works the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\u00a0and the Philosophical Investigations. There will also be some treatment of the historical and philosophical context of Wittgenstein's work and life."

For Kierkegaard, the fundamental problem of philosophy was to describe what it means and what it takes to become human\u2014suggesting, ironically, that it is possible for a human being not to be human. The primary purpose of this\u00a0course\u00a0is to read Kierkegaard\u2019s most influential texts closely, situate them in their historical and philosophical context (namely, early 19th Century Western Europe), and draw out their contemporary relevance, paying particular attention to the concepts of irony, anxiety, despair, love, and faith. \u00a0"

What is the nature of reasoning, and how should we discern good argumentation from bad? Philosophers of the medieval Arabic-Islamic tradition, such as al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, Ibn S\u012bn\u0101, and Ibn Rushd, proposed detailed answers to these and other related questions, grounding their proposals in powerful arguments. By adopting a broadly Aristotelian framework, but going well beyond its confines, these figures paved the way for later European Latin philosophy, which borrows heavily from their insights. We'll study those insights and their reception in this class."

Many scholars have rejected the idea that the persistence of a number of racial ills \u2013 like racial inequality, racial discrimination and racial segregation \u2013 in the contemporary moment is evidence that racism also persists as a problem in the twenty-first century. \u201cRacism,\u201d these scholars argue, more accurately describes the Jim Crow South and the people in that era who consciously held explicit beliefs about white superiority over all other races. Though acknowledging changes in racial climate and the terrain of acceptable speech with regards to race, other scholars think that unequal racial outcomes, institutional practices and ideological beliefs connect our contemporary racial problems to racial problems that occurred in the 1960s and earlier. This course is an introduction to the scholarship on racism and has as a central aim to get us to judge together whether \u201cracism\u201d is the appropriate concept to describe and provide a frame through which to understand our contemporary problems concerning race. If it is, which accounts of racism are the most compelling to shed light on our current racial circumstances? What about these accounts are particularly pertinent? What can\u2019t the accounts of racism addressed in class explain? If racism is not the right concept to capture our current struggles with race (or all aspects of it), what concepts if any do a better job and why? To facilitate a critical interrogation of the concept racism, this course will cover sociological, historical, social psychological, philosophical and political accounts of racism and related concepts like racial injustice, racial prejudice, race relations, and racial inequality."

Students receive a full semester of college credit (16 units) while volunteering full-time in a Presidential U.S. Senate U.S. House or gubernatorial campaign. The program is offered during Presidential and Mid-term elections. Students can volunteer for a Republican or Democratic campaign or a \"minor\" party if the campaign is set up to adequately supervise volunteers. The program is open to all Oxy students regardless of major. Students who participate in Campaign Semester take the following three courses (POLS 270, POLS 271, POLS 272) simultaneously. Students will participate in the daily activities of a campaign for United States President or United States Senate in a key \"battleground\" state. Students will gain experience in the highest level of politics and gain an understanding of how a national presidential campaign or a statewide United States Senate campaign is operated. Students will learn about political strategy voter contact and turnout messaging and polling communications volunteer recruitment and team-building fundraising and other key aspects of campaigns. The internship will involve working full-time (a minimum of 40 hours a week) from the first day of class until Election Day. Following that ten-week campaign fieldwork internship students will return to campus and participate in two seminars as part of Campaign Semester. Campaigns involve long hard days. The staff that students will work with will typically be working at least 14-16 hour days. Although students are required to work at least 8 hours a day they are likely to work more. As part of the Campaign Fieldwork Internship students will be required to read three books-biographies of each major party candidate and a book describing previous presidential campaigns. Students will be required to maintain an internship journal that will be handed in at the end of the 10-week internship. The journal will describe their activities (including the projects they work on campaign meetings and events relationship of the campaign to the media and to constituency groups) the internal dynamics and work of the campaign the different roles and tasks of staff and volunteers in the campaigns the way the media reports on the campaign the students' reflections on these matters and at the end a summary of the campaign outcome. Students will be required to email the supervising Occidental faculty member at least once a week about their activities and reflections. The students will be supervised in the field by a campaign staff member. Students will participate through teleconferencing in a two-hour course meeting with other students and faculty three times during the semester. Students who will be working in different parts of the country will stay in touch with each other as well as with the faculty through Moodle a web-based course management system. The system allows faculty members to post readings facilitate discussions give and receive assignments etc. Students in various parts of the country will thus form a virtual classroom and on-line learning community. Some students may wish to document their experiences on the campaign trail observe events and interview staff and volunteers by making videos. If so these should be posted to the faculty and other students via the internet. Enrollment limited to students participating in the Campaign Semester Program.\u00a0"

How should the competing demands of individual independence and community solidarity be balanced? How can we best counter modern society\u2019s tendency to engender stifling conformity?

In addition to dominant forms of Protestant Christianity, we will learn about the rise of new religions like Spiritualism and Mormonism, Catholic and Jewish immigration in the late nineteenth century, and the growth of religions like Buddhism and Islam in the twentieth. Throughout the course, we will pay\u00a0special attention to race and ethnicity, gender, and sexuality, asking how religion has alternately served as a vehicle for liberation and venue of oppression, and how religious debates dovetailed with the pressing social issues of the day."

Some aspiring utopias, like that of the People's Temple in Jonestown, Guyana, ended in dramatic displays of violence and death. Others, like the Mormons in Salt Lake City, have succeeded in the face of sustained adversity. But most land somewhere in between, sustaining themselves through partial integration with dominant society. In this course, we will study different intentional religious communities - often called \"cults\" or \"sects\" by outsiders - throughout the Americas. As we study the Oneidan \"free love\" community, an ayahuasca church in Brazil, an early Rastafari group in Jamaica, we'll ask questions like: Why have religious people sought to separate themselves from society? How have they appealed to scripture or revelation to justify their separation? What challenges - such as external political pressure or internal strife - have they faced? What groups have been \"successful,\" and what are the measures of success? And what do these attempts\u00a0 at establishing utopias tell us about what it means to be religious?"

And according to some prominent researchers, the \"mystical experience\"--or a feeling of union with the divine--produced from these drugs is key to their therapeutic efficacy. But is this claim valid? And why would scientists make such a claim in the first place? In this course, we will answer these and related questions by exploring the global cultural history of psychedelics from the early twentieth century to the present. With special attention to the relationship between psychedelics and religion, we will examine everything from these substances' ritual consumption in indigenous communities and in pre-modern Europe, to scholars' and researchers' use of religious texts to explain psychedelic experiences, to legal issues surrounding psychedelic use and religious freedom."

With course materials including scholarly readings, as well as films, documentaries, music, podcasts, comedy and visual images, we will pay particular attention to the lived aspects of queer engagements with religion. For instance, we will cover topics such as Judeo-Christian reinterpretations of Genesis to make room for same-sex marriage; conceptions of transgenderism in the time of the Prophet Muhammad; gender fluidity in iconography of the Buddhist boddhisatva, Kuan-yin; gender role mixing in Tantric Hindu ritual; and, Native American postcolonial approaches to HIV within the \u201ctwo-spirit\u201d community.

In addition to surveying apocryphal texts and their early Christian contexts the major assignment of the course will be to collaborate with Prof. Upson-Saia on her current research project: a study of how ideas found in the New Testament Apocrypha persist in Catholic tradition-specifically in Catholic doctrine art and liturgy-even though the texts themselves were excluded from the Christian Bible.\"\u00a0Open to Juniors and Seniors."

This course will consider how these historical media have developed into a\u00a0considerable variation in the contemporary forms of media used to represent, promulgate, and critique religious traditions in Asia, as well as how the circulation of this media continues to create both community and division.

Why was there a kimono specialist in the costume department of Westworld? How did Ruth E. Carter develop her Afrofuturist vision for Black Panther? Where would you find visual and dramaturgical resources for Vietgone, or Hair, or Cambodian Rock Band, the action of each set in a similar historical period but whose stories are told from very different cultural perspectives?

    "description": "In this course students will learn to combine the reporter's craft with creative writing skills to produce compelling nonfiction. The class teaches students how accurate, factual stories can more fully convey insight into contemporary issues and the human condition by tapping the power of fictional techniques such as character development, use of dramatic tension, dialogue, and narrative structure. The course develops students' research, reporting, and interviewing techniques, while focusing on the craft of writing. Using the spectrum of rhetorical devices, students will strive to create well-told stories about who we are, how we live, and the forces that shape our existence.\u00a0"

    "name": "Rhetorical Fault Lines: Journalism, Persuasion, Propaganda",
    "description": "The 21st century has seen an abrupt escalation of government, corporate, and nonprofit institutions' use of technology-sharpened rhetorical tools to disseminate information and, increasingly, disinformation to individuals and the public. Journalism, one of democracy's most important forces for distinguishing truth from propaganda, has simultaneously been decimated by technological and economic change. This course offers an insider's perspective on the theory and practice of rhetorical persuasion. This course will examine the forces that shape public opinion about recent history's most significant issues, including climate disruption, education, immigration, and war. With a focus on opinion journalism, this course examines historical and current practices globally in examples such as Nazi and Stalinist propaganda in WWII, to international discourse on Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan.\u00a0Students will learn to write and critique editorials, op-eds, blog posts, and strategic communications' plans driven by social media messaging, while scrutinizing the shared interests and deep tensions between journalism and public relations, publicity and marketing."
